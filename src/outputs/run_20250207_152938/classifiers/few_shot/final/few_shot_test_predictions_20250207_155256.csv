how do i make it stop? i don't want legal trouble for being a ""stalker"" ... i don't want to kill myself. i just never had any luck with those head shrink people and i'm fucking lonely and i'm fucking miserable.

"i want to, but i can't.. completely unfair..
hi reddit,

i've been depressed and suicidal for the past 2-3 years now. everyday gets harder to get through and i always pray i never have to see tomorrow but, i end up waking up every morning and have to face life again.

i've been through counselling and therapy, tried to reconnect with old friends, tried out old things i used to love doing as well as tried to get involved in new things, and tried to make new friends just to keep things fresh. i've now got to the point where i don't think i can hold on for much longer. i have tried everything i can to stay alive and now i don't even want to bother trying any more.. it's getting too painful. every time i've had a suicidal thought cross my mind, i've always thought of one thing, and that has always made me stop in my tracks and live for another day. my family.

there is only 3 of us in the family after my father decided to selfishly leave. since then i've had to act as the father figure/head of the family to my mother and my younger brother. i have lost out on so much growing up because i've had to take on this responsibility a lot earlier than i should have to. i am financially supporting my family and without it, their whole life would sink. this is the only reason i've kept myself alive all these years. if i decided to go ahead with suicide, who would take care of my family? where would the financial help come from? i've looked at life insurance policies that state a payout for suicide cannot be made if it occurs within the first/second year: a length of time i cannot wait for.

i find it totally unfair that i cannot die in peace and will have to take the guilt of my family being stuck in financial trouble after i go and there is no where they can turn to for help, or a payout that would fill in for me. it used to motivate me before and hold me back from suicide but now i can't see myself getting through the week.

does anyone know of any schemes or policies that will take care of your family financially after you go? please do reply and let me know. i will greatly appreciate it.

thank you for reading.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i’m 14 years old. i’m failing school. i’ve been taken off my meds and my depression is getting worse. i dissociate almost every hour of the day and have nightmares every night due to being molested when i was five. 

i don’t see a future for myself. i was a gifted child who’s worth was determined by my performance in school, and now i’m a burnt out failure. everyday it feels like mounds of schoolwork bear down on my already burdened soul. the only thing i can ever find comfort in anymore is video games and reading.

i look around at my very few friends and they’re all better than me. more talented. more smart. more happy. it feels like they don’t even see me, much less care about me. i wouldn’t care either.

"important decision, think through itnot about to pull the i'm going to do it at this time bs.  this is no cry for help because, the truth is, when you've been in such a mental state that this is always an option, you know it's only a matter of time. 

i fucked up.  during a manic period, i turned relatively nothing into a million dollars playing the game of speculation.  i lost my mind, and subsequently, nearly all of that money.

i have since gotten in shape, taken a shitty job with good benefits, and taken on some life insurance.  the grief is a killer- i'd have offed myself nine months ago if not for a wife and kid.  anyway, the physical progress isn't translating into an improved mental state.  knowing winter is right around the corner, with a history of seasonal affective disorder, i'm fucked. 

yes, i should get on some meds.  problem is, then i won't be able to get the additional life insurance.  so i continue to self medicate, fully planning to abstain from booze for a month or two before my next life insurance physical as i know my liver ain't happy and gotta get them enzymes down.  

finances are the trigger.  wifey biz always run like a hobby even though it occupies 40+ hours a week so some contribution would be nice, even though i fully admit to fucking up financially.  fact is, i made the money same way it was lost.  that said, i am in no state to go it alone as sole breadwinner right now.

times have changed, i am not capable of being the sole provider for this family (1 kid), and i will always see suicide as an option.  of course, i don't expect someone w/o constant ideation to understand.  the mental process of the clinically depressed is fucked.  no, i'm not neurotic, i'm fucked up in the head.

counting the days to that two-year uncontestability period and looking to add some premium in the mean time if i can get them enzymes in check.  who knows when that car accident could occur?  

tonight my little one yelled goodnight to me through the window as i cut the grass.  i nearly broke down walking behind the mower, once again reminded of my mistakes and my destiny.  going to miss those moments.  tried to explain to the wife that i need her to help out financially and she acts as if things are the same as they've always been (business not contributing and even me bailing it out personally multiple times in the past).  problem is, this isn't the past.  i am on the verge of suicide and don't feel i'm capable of more than i'm providing now.  just a little help???

all i know is it was easier being a have-not than it is going from having it all to relatively nothing.   i've experienced both, and i'm in a worse mental state as a result.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i had i really disturbing dream last night it started with me driving around the country, i've never dived but for some reason i felt like i was going really fast, but the world around me didn't change, it went by as if i was going at a normal speed.

the dream is out of order so i'm saying it in the order shit happened

i was in the house a house id moved out of 6 years ago in the living room where i just murdered a girl in my class i used to have a crush on 2 years ago. i don't recall how i actually murdered her, she was dead though. body was purple and covered with orange and red wounds. her intestines were sticking out her right breast for some reason. i saw them and i took a section of intestine and tore it in half, and proceeded to take a small mouse and shove it on the intestine. the girl wasn't dead, however, she sobbed softly. 

now i'm back in the car, and this other car is behind me going fast. 

yknow how sometimes in dreams you can see things in another building even though you're in a completely different place? that happened.

a group of girls i know we're all in a black car chasing me. and i was going fast too but i guess not enough.

for some reason i stop and jump out the car and start running inhumanly fast. the girls couldn't catch up, and were also out of the car.

then i remember doing parlour, it felt like i was, although i was just running in between very narrow spaces in between buildings of a town i think i remember. the girls had now catched up to me. the moment one lays a hand on me in back in my childhood house.

then i'm back in my house panicked and pacing. i go get a knife and stick in right in my addamsapple. the knife sunk like a 1000 degree knife going into a cake. with blood waterfalling down my body. i dropped.

the last thing i remember us all the girls celebrating by texting each other.

"i dont need to think of a creative title for this.  i am hurting.i've had a diagnosis of severe depression and possible bipolar disorder since about 8th grade.  at the middle of 11th grade, i lost nearly 40 pounds due to an eating disorder.  i am now a month away from completing my freshman year and am struggling with all of these things.

i've had my ups and downs, but mainly i've been having a blast in college.  i don't know why, but over time, shit started to eat away at me, and the past week has been miserable.

i hate myself.  i obviously have extremely fucked up views on myself (body, mind, and soul) which is why my eating disorder thrived.  i have been on so many different medications over the years to try to help me cope including zoloft, effexor, welbutrin, depakote, and lithium.  i was doing the best for the three years i was on lithium 900 mg and effexor and welbutrin at the same time, but i had to quit taking lithium because it messed up my thyroid.

i have now been on a low dose of prozac for awhile.  i have gotten to the point where i know i don't want to make it past college.  i really don't.  i've honestly just lost myself.  i want to self destruct.  i feel bad for everybody whose lives i have come into because i have such a charming and charismatic personality.  i'm not shy and i am outgoing and kind to everyone, so i have made many friends in college.  i feel bad that they have had to meet me, because i am just going to self destruct and eventually off myself.

i feel the most pain for my mom.  i love my mom so much and i am so sorry she had to end up with me, it wasn't her fault.  my mom and dad spent their whole lives saving money and raising me and my older brother right so we could live good lives and have kids and carry on the family name.  but, my brother is gay and going to get judged by society and what about their daughter?  she's not going to make it past college.  the least i could do to thank my parents is try my hand at life, but i have been for years and it hasn't gone so well so far.

today should be a good day for me too, i moved i to my new appartment, hanging out with a friend and staying the night at her place. and yet all i can think about is slitting my worthless throat wide open and watching the blood fill the sink.

i've no reason to live, i've nothing left to offer this world. i keep claiming i want to be a writer yet i can't even get my ass to sit down and write anymore. i'm probably an alcoholic and a drug addict and i'm not sure i give a damn.

when i was 18 i tried to end my life i took a bunch of pills a half arsed it and that just fucked with my brain, nothings been the same since i have massive amounts of anxiety and am spaced a lot of the time, i made a promise to myself that if i where to try to commit suicide again i will be serious about it and follow through,  i have moments of clarity maybe a month where it’s like i’m the old me and i crush it but those moments are few and far between these days. 

i’m 21 now, i want to hang myself... but who really cares? it’s not like i have any positive effect on anyone’s life, i don’t want to burden people with my stuff feeling empathy or sympathy for me is a waste. idk what i’m doing anymore what is all this...",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i've said this many times on this sub but i will say it again, i will do itliving with an abusive and an irrationally angered father is not gonna make my life better. there is not a single day that he calls me and my brother idiots for the smallest reasons such as forgetting to take out the trash even if it's half full. he told me to leave the house once (whick i did, but only for 3 days) when he saw my grades and he wasn't very happy with having a b- in it. he doesn't want me to even get a part time job even if i can squeeze it into my weekly schedule, he doesn't let me out of the house at all, he doesn't give me the freedoms other college kids have nowadays. i never did drugs, i never sipped on any type of alcohol, i never smoked, so i always ask myself why and what is his reasoning behind all this? i don't care if it's okay for him to put this many rules in the house. because he doesn't care for my well being, then neither will i. i'm gonna find a way to end this quickly and as painlessly as possible. he kept us locked in a cell to be ""disciplined"" for no reason but when he asks me why am i not taking my brother out to the mall or somewhere else, my brain shrinks in eternal cringe triggering anger. not inky he's abusive, he's a hypocrite. he yells at us for small errors, small mistakes, but now that i think about it, i may actually deserve it. after all, i need a reason to ""euthanize"" myself so i'll be done with all of this because playing skyrim with over 10gb worth of mods installed is not gonna cut it. i just wanna end it all. i can't leave the house and i have no car, no job, no money, nothing. i am nothing. i'm done living with a psychotic parent and i will not live my life to see myself become one, so i need to be put out of my misery not only to stop this monster within me from growing, but to send the asshole a message that will be forever etched on his dumbass brain. i just don't have the courage to do so but waiting for an accident to happen is gonna take me a while.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i know my thought is fucked up and i can't help it. can someone maybe make me realise how wrong i am?i have seen a lot of posts talking about how they are still here just because they don't want to upset their families. i totally get that as i myself is experiencing the same thing as well. i have not done it because i know my parents care about me and i can't even imagine how they would react if i'm gone, let alone how it would hurt them or how my other dickhead relatives might judge them.

to approach a problem, i always like to see it almost from a third-person-angle. this lets me think of a solution in an objective way like an emotionless robot.

back to the focus of this post. i know this can sound very fucked up but thats the solution i came up with. now objectively speaking, the problem that i'm dealing with is 'i want to kill myself but i can't because it will upset my parents and i don't want them to go though that'. that means, the obstacle is the very fact that 'my parents will stay alive after i make the move'. i think the solution is pretty obvious at this point and i can already sense the disgust of people reading this towards me. that's right, what about, i kill them first, then there will be nothing stopping me to achieve my goal. after they are gone, there will be nothing holding me back, no need to worry about how sad they will be, no need to worry about how they will deal with their lives after i'm gone, nothing, finally.

i know some of you might think that it is not that easy for this plan to work in practice. but honestly, my parents have complete trust on me and we have really good relationships. it would not be difficult to put a knife in their throats or just slice them open, one by one.

i know this is very selfish, but isn't this what suicide is all about? we can't stand to live with whatever we are dealing with anymore and that's why we want an escape, once and for all. most likely though, i will never have the guts to actually go with this plan but the fact that i can even come up with this whole idea does bother me from time to time. but then again, i would always tell myself, 'isn't this the most direct way to solve this problem?'.

i apologise if i make your day even worse by making this post. i'm so sorry.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"third time's the charmten and a half years ago: i'm standing in an open balcony of a high-rise building. it's very early in the morning. i'm thinking about the two girls from my old school that i bumped into while walking here. funny how those two almost complete strangers are going to be the last people who would ever see me alive. i wonder what were they doing walking down the street nonchalantly at five in the morning. the barrier that separates me from my fate reaches almost to my shoulders. *i clumsily climb on to of it, somehow stand on it and jump.*

a year and a half ago: once again i'm standing in an open balcony of a high-rise building. different building, same city. weather is different too: cold wind drains sensation from my fingers. i'm talking to someone on this subreddit, complaining that jumping from heights is not an ideal way to go: you have to conquer two fears, of death itself, and of heights. *i put my phone on the concrete floor. the barrier is similar in height, but i have grown. still clumsy as always i climb on top of it, try to stand, but lose my footing and start tumbling down through the air. the last thought flashes through my mind: ""it's not the fall that kills you, it's the sudde*

"idk how to feelit's late and i can't sleep so i'm just gonna type this up

for the past year and a half i just haven't been feeling like myself anymore. about three years ago, work and life pulled me away from keeping in touch with close friends and family. last summer, i called up my grandpa, who i hadn't talked to in awhile but i was trying to start to catch up with everyone that i had put off when life got busy. he's as always been my number one role model in life and has always been that person that i could rely on to care about me. mid-conversation, i lost him unexpectedly and it's been haunting me ever since. it's like i feel his pain and confusion in his voice every night and i hate it. i've gotten better over the last six months, but i still feel this huge amount of regret for putting of calling him for so long and not telling him how much i loved him, because i didn't even know what happened until a couple of days after the phonecall.

i haven't even told anyone about losing my grandpa because, for one, my friends don't know who he is because i never really talk about stuff that's too personal and i don't like making others feel like they need to feel bad for me. 

i can't even tell my dad how i feel about my grandpa because he doesn't even know that i ever met my grandpa (it's my mom's dad, and my parents divorced, so my dad absolutely hates anyone on her side of the family), and would be really upset if he found out that my mom used to fly me out there to see him when i was younger, and i just don't want more conflict. 

recently i've also felt like such a burden to my dad, and for no concrete reason that i can put my finger on. he's a self-made guy, and my whole life he's told me i don't appreciate what i have and he's always comparing me to other kids, even my best friends, saying they would love to be in my shoes, etc. my dad also used to always get super mad at me for wanting to call my mom. when i was younger, i think things like this were the root of a lot of self-confidence issues, but luckily i got over those, but what lasted was my fear of letting anyone see my emotions. i love my dad a lot, and i think that he just has some character flaws, but i know that he loves me a lot.

it's weird because i have a lot going for me, i have a lot of close friends that really care about me, and i get good grades (in university), but it's like my brain sometimes doesn't want to recognize any of that and all i can feel is a sense of guilt for mentally pushing away people that are close to me all the time, including my mom who has skin cancer and idek how long i have left with her... 


i feel like such a burden and i feel like i'm not qualified to feel this much pain like this because my life is objectively great and i have a lot of great goals, i'm active, etc. i just want the pain to stop, but i feel selfish for even saying any of this.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm trapped and tired of existing.well, my first attempt to write this was excessively long. maybe i can give a summarized version.

it would take a book to explain the whole situation. the summary would be this: i grew up in an abusive home, was bullied at school, had few friends, no social skills, terrible grades despite scoring extremely high on tests, and was eventually tossed out of school on my ass. for a twist, it turns out i had mild autism the whole time and no one, including me, figured it out until over 15 years later. so, i entered adult life with no social skills, no life skills, no practical skills, no education, a broken family, and my only support a couple of grandparents whose solution to everything was to throw money at the problem while mismanaging their own affairs, and tell me how i and everything else should be.

things got better for a little while when i got involved in a church, made some friends, and got on the inside of a social circle for the first and only time in my life. it didn't last, as these people had expectations, and i am horrible at living up to others' expectations. long story short, the situation reached critical mass and blew up in my face. i don't attend church any more, and likely never will again.

still, i managed to live up to a few expectations. i managed to get a job, which was very difficult for me due to the autism i didn't know i had. i met someone who seemed to understand what i've been through and ended up marrying here. both of these situations have deteriorated severely. the job, though i have kept it for many years, is draining the life out of me and provides me with only a meager income. my wife is as well, she is not a very understanding person, and communication between us is horrible. i feel like i've made strong efforts to make things right, but one sided efforts don't make relationships work. i didn't want to be that guy who walks out on his wife, but now we have kids and leaving would mean serious consequences to me. with my low income, i couldn't afford to live if i had to pay child support and support myself, especially with how biased the courts are against fathers in these cases, particularly in my state. and i wouldn't want to live and not be with my kids anyways. so, i'm trapped in this relationship.

lots of other issues have been going on. my house is falling apart, my car is dying, my health is going bad, and i can't afford to deal with any of these issues adequately. i have ideas, dreams, and hopes but i don't have the time, opportunity, education, or resources to develop or act on any of them. everything i want has been placed out of my reach. i have no friends, no family that i trust, no support network, and a wife who makes me feel more alone than if i *were* alone. i can't afford a therapist. i have no options to move, change things, or alter the course of my life. i feel like i have no control over anything anymore. i'm just here, being a workhorse that supports my family and serves no other purpose. and there is nothing i can do to change it, no hope of being anything more.

everyone has problems. problems aren't the problem. my problem is that the problems seem to have no solution. i can see no options. i can't get out of my situation. i have no alternate job options in my area. i'm trapped in this sardine can of a house, with noise and activity that makes me feel paralyzed with sensory overload, a wife i have to constantly walk on eggshells around and work to keep happy, and just enough financial resources to get by and have a little wiggle room. i'm tired. i feel trapped. i see no solution that doesn't create a bigger problem. i'm ready to give up. i don't want to. i'd rather find a solution to the problems. but i don't see one. and i don't have the fortitude left to keep going on like this. i am beyond spent. i don't actually want to die, but i'm tired of living. if this is all it's going to be, then what's the point? if my life is destined to be a waste or a tragedy, then i'd prefer it at least be a relatively short one.

the good news, i suppose, is that i have never been able to harm myself. i can't even prick my skin with a needle. i'd make a terrible diabetic. but i have spent hours trying to figure out ways to circumvent this mental block, and i find myself spending more and more time trying to find a way. i would love to find an alternative to ceasing to exist, but i don't see one.

let me just preclude a few common, go-to responses that people will likely try to throw at me:

* i can't afford a therapist, a marriage counselor, or anything of the like. i don't have friends. i don't have family that will understand. i don't have people i can confide in or talk to that won't just make things worse. i live just outside of a tiny rural community and few resources are available. commuting to other towns is expensive, and i'm poor.

"anyone really stressed out 'bout the future? **note: this is a question to everyone and it is a serious topic i am wondering about. however, my introduction post is just a rant/me freaking out so i set it to rant instead.**

  
look, i am just about to head into grade 11 and i am stressed out of my mind right now.  
grade 11... just two more years left until i graduate and have to start applying to universities and also have to worry about work/income in the future. it feels so close and its terrifying.  


i thought i would be fine but as the days come closer and closer, it just becomes even more scary. grades become super important in these next years, same with volunteering and you have to manage all that to make yourself look good to universities (over here in canada, supposedly universities like volunteering a lot). of course learning to manage it is a good experince for the future but during the present its the worst. i have a feeling stress will not be coming down these two years and i will just be having a mental warfare this entire time.  


it's not like i am doing bad in school, i have had usually most a's with b's but the thing is, i chose not to do internation bacceleraute program now after doing two years of pre-ib. i dont think i am someone who can deal with that stress but now i know that for students outside of ib have to get like a 95% average in school to go to one of the good uni's in canada (according to my counselours) and that is super stressful.  


on top of that, this year we had a certain major event that lasted for many months. that event completely messed up the school year for us too. we had online education for like 5 months and it wasn't exactly the best. we didn't learn a whole lot and its much harder to retain that information for me. the fact of the matter is that did not help me remember what i learned last year and now coming this year into grade 11 its still unstable. supposedly its planned until a vaccine is out and we can acquire it, we will only have two days of in-class learning. the rest of it being remote. how will that effect our education and what we can learn. how will that effect our ability on final exams. how will it effect our chances at university. honestly speaking, online learning was quite easy last year but that was not a good thing. what about grade 12 where we will most likely be having normal school again. if the previous years, the education was too easy then how will it effect our learning for the grade 12 which is our final chance at getting a good grade.

  
i have more to say but not going to lie, this is already too much written.  


**tldr:** with the current events going around the world, i am stressed out about the fact that i am only two years away from graduation and i am afraid that my grades/education will be effected greatly due to this global event.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0
"i need so much help.i'm 22 years old. i'm 2 months out of a long term relationship. she's with someone else, but i saw her for 2 nights this past week and we had sex again. she expressed doubt that she'd be able to face her boyfriend again since this, but she has with no problem. i've begged and pleaded to get back together with her and she doesn't seem to care, no one seems to care. 

i can't talk to anyone, i tried therapy but i omitted the fact that i had a plan for suicide 3 weeks ago. my best friend and my ex both know it happened but no one else does, and no one knows that i'm at that point right now. my brother is away for the army, my mom is around but we aren't close. my father died when i was 8. i have an awesome job that i love, but i can't shake the feeling that cold steel against my forehead wouldn't be such a bad feeling right now. i'm fucking miserable, i don't know what to do. 

i feel worthless, cheated, abandoned, used, meaningless. i feel like no one gives a fuck about me, and besides having to clean up and repaint my room, my suicide wouldn't affect anyone. i miss my brother and father more than anything, and i miss that relationship with the girl of my dreams. i'm rambling and don't know what else to say. i go to the gym, it doesn't help. i go to work, it doesn't help. my ex is in everything i do and see, and i feel like i'm not even a thought in her mind. i constantly feel i have to fill my father's shoes, and i'm failing miserably. i'm a constant disappointment.

"i feel like suicide is the only possible answeri'm 21 and starting my ""fourth year"" of college. i've been struggling with depression since middle school (diagnosed as clinical depression) and as if it weren't bad enough, two years ago i started having really bad anxiety (diagnosed as general anxiety disorder). i spent my first year of college at a community college and despite feeling continuously low and having zero friends, i passed my classes fine. i transferred to a university for my second year and things were a little rocky, but i did okay my first semester. my second semester, i dropped out of my classes halfway through because my depression and anxiety were too much. my third year, i tried both semesters to attend school and dropped out both times. 

my family thinks i'm trying again this year, but really i'm living in an apartment that my best friend pays for while she goes to school and works and i sit on my bum all day. last february, i stayed in a hospital for a week, but it didn't help a bit. i've been on different meeds continuously since i was 17 and i'm at a point where the pills keep me just functioning enough to get up and eat, shower, and not sleep all day (just half the day). i'm being pressured by my best friend to work, and i understand that, but even going out to buy milk results in a panic attack. my family gives me an allowance every few weeks, enough to buy my anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills and see my therapist every other week. 

so i'm at this point, where i have a good bit of school loans on my shoulders (luckily not as much as it could be, since i withdrew so early these last two semesters) and going back to school is clearly not an option. working isn't an option! going home isn't an option, because i'll be guilted and every waking moment will be spent answering questions as to why i'm not in school or working, because my family doesn't understand why i can't ""just keep going"". they think if i ""get out and do things"" i'll be okay. they think i'm depressed and anxious because i'm idle, not that i'm idle because i'm depressed and anxious.

i don't know where to go now. my therapist and i were seeing each other weekly, but i have stumped her. i've been seeing her since coming to uni (my community college was in my hometown, my uni is 5 hours from my home town) and she's great. i've had an easy time talking to her. but now we're at a stand-still where nothing is helping. i don't really feel happy anymore. i'm sad, anxious, and have been having really awful bouts of rage over the dumbest things. i want to hurt myself, but i put all my razors and such away and it would be too much effort to get to them. but i feel like there's not really anything left for me. i'm just draining people of their money. everyone is tired of me and how i won't do anything, how i'm ""not making an effort"". death looks like the only choice from where i'm standing.",suicide,suicide,1.0

eternal sleep might reduce my mum's life too as i'm the first born, but then it might not cause she's lost all hopes in me, and it'll reduce her financial burden. either way it will affect my younger ones. the two older men in their life gone. the only other guy is the last born. and i know they will get over it eventually

the second; means. if i had or knew how to get a gun, i most likely wouldn't be here now. i don't want to be in pain when going, but i'm tired of living. in the end no matter the pain, from drowning, poisoning, whatever, it will eventually end. 

but still i can't bring myself to do it. i don't know what i'm waiting for, i know i'll eventually do it. i just don't know when. i guess i'm hoping things can get better, but i don't see how. 

i have no access to therapy and can't get one, i have no one i feel comfortable to talk to/with. i'm just fed up of crying really. i don't know.

i can't imagine a future for myself, i no longer have goals. i do have one wish tho. that i could live away from home. only if i could afford to - which would be the case if i didn't fuck my life up, but that's the cycle of my only other way out.",suicide,suicide,1.0

and if one more fucking person asks me how much i weight, i’ll literally fucking kill myself right then and there. my meds fucked me over and while i don’t feel as anxious anymore i also don’t have a goddamn appetite. drs just tell me to force food. weed is the only thing that can give me a bit of appetite. so leave me the fuck alone irl people.

i wanna fuck things over. i want to go crazy and tell everyone the fuck off. tell them what i really feel about them. when i left my local school no one gave a shit. i left without notice and not a single person even contacted me to ask where i went. no one cared. but then i decide to post a photo on my insta wearing a crop top and finally being open about my did and so many messages. i guess i’m only interesting when i have a fucking complex as hell disorder. 

but sometimes i want to live to be better than them and wow, what high expectations i have for myself. i know school isn’t everything and these people shouldn’t matter but i haven’t really had a real real friend that i didn’t fuck it up with. i always get way too attached and happy that i do or say something or i’m just annoying and clingy as hell. i wish people would just tell me if they don’t like me as a friend.

sometimes i get so angry. where i want to contact every person that has hurt me and just fucking tell them off. tell them about how i literally attempted suicide so many times because of some of them. then i fall back into the sadness. i just want happiness and stability. is this all life is? is it as terrible as it seems? where i’ll have to work unbearable hours to pay for basic supplies and a house. it doesn’t sound like a good time. i don’t see what the reward is for living. children? i’m not bringing a child into this world and especially not adopting a kid if my housing sucks and it’s just me. i can’t do shit. 

i just kinda wish i had a choice. or maybe a different upbringing. selfish as hell, but it’s true. maybe if i grew up different i wouldn’t be like this. maybe i wouldn’t have to constantly wonder if my entire life and disorders are a delusion itself, which they could be, i don’t even know if they’re real or not. who knows.

"tips to ask whatever you want from your lover **try not to use the “you” word.**

saying things like “you made me feel bad when you didn’t introduce me to your friends” or “i always get mad at you for the messy bathroom” will make you look like you’re being accused, and they may close the door or attack you.

try using words like “i feel left out if i’m not introduced to people” or “your bathroom must be tidy to start your day properly.” changing from “you” to “i” removes your suggestion’s accusatory tone and focuses on your feelings instead.

**make sure it’s a two-way conversation.**

yes, you should be able to demand what you want most (and least) in a relationship – but your partner should do the same.

if you are the only one who should ask, try asking your partner what they want in the relationship. if you both work hard to make your relationship happier, everyone wins.

"my experience at trader joe’s soo yesterday my mom and i went to trader joe’s , first of all it was about 7 pm and it was dark out. when we came in i was blasted with soo many lights, it was a little too well-lit. anyway we shopped for some veggies and stuff like that, and then we came to the register. my mom decided to stand off to the far side of the register, as if she was about to leave the store already. that meant i was stuck with the cashier in front of me to do all the social talking (i have a soft voice and i’m a 17 y/o guy) so she was all like “how are you doing today did you need a bag?” and i tell her “i’m good how are you?” but because of my mask my voice was barely audible to her. and she stared at me as if i didn’t have manners, which just had me standing so awkward there. i hate that kind of interaction. then she asks me if i needed a bag and i said “do you charge for it?” and she heard me this time and said “yeah, it’s 10 cents”. i turn to my mom to ask her if that was fine but the cashier girl beat me to it and asked her if we needed the bag. in the end that was just a horrible experience for me because the girl looked like she was 19, or maybe even in high school still. it made me look like i didn’t want to talk to her but i’m a really sweet guy, but i just have a soft voice that can’t be heard through a mask in a loud environment sometimes. and to make it even worse, as my mom and i were walking to the car she tells me “you should speak up when people are talking to you”... like i did, but if i speak loud enough i feel like i’m yelling, and i hate yelling. that was my experience at that place being introverted, having a soft voice at the same time, and being a 17 y/o guy :(",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

i tell myself this is only for a limited duration, that it will all be ok once i graduate, but could i be dealing myself some kind of long-term mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that i consider ending my life just to escape it?

""where are you? we've been waiting for you! you were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago, and i checked and your flight landed on time! what's that? i don't know where that is! i don't know where you are! explain your location to me in more detail!""

the funny thing is, i pretty much knew where he'd be (it's an airport, you can only be in so many places), but he couldn't just wait for me to show up. he had to be a bully about it.

turned around, pulled out my phone, bought an afternoon return ticket. 

i never left the terminal. i never even left the concourse. got lunch right there, waited to board, came back home. christmas is over for me and it hasn't even begun yet.

i'm not sad. i feel pretty good about it. family bullies never expect you to call their bluff. they expect you to ""muddle through somehow"" because that's what everyone does. doubly so when they know you've made travel plans and sunk cash into tickets. but hey, guess what? low-cost carriers have some pretty cheap fares, even at the last second. sometimes you can even get your original ticket refunded.

growing up as a little kid i struggled to make friends and often got manipulated (i was very gullible), and them abandoning me as a friend. this over time along with other life experiences lead me to become scared of abandonment of people who i make friends with. this lead to me to try to be a funny person and always trying to impress others as i felt that otherwise they would abandon me. i am now 16 and i feel that i have a really good group of friends that could maybe be my friends for life. although, recently these friends have started to exclude me from things like talking with each other in discord calls, they no longer text me, they play video games without me, and when we meet in person no one pays attention to when i am speaking. suddenly it feels like the only friends i have dislike and are drifting away from me. i have tried to confront them about it but i get scared and instead fear to deliver the question.  i don't know if they are excluding me or i am self-conscious over that i may lose my friends.  advice would be appreciated!!!",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

a whole bunch of shit has been happening and i'm not handling it well. i've kind of made up my mind that this coming sunday will be my last one. it's kind of poetic really, and here are the reasons why. 

1. i was raped two sundays ago. more info on that is in my post history. 

2. i was raised mormon, but am no longer a member - so what better day than on the ""lord's day""? 

i've begun the process of pushing people away, so they don't get hurt - but that is taking too long i guess. people will be hurt, but i won't be anymore.

"is there a way to kill yourself from the world without actually killing yourself?i don't know where i should start, or if venting and getting these thoughts out is a good idea in general, but i guess i'll give it a shot. 

i don't know who i am anymore. i genuinely don't. i don't find joy in the things that not once, not twice, but have *always* have made a happier, outgoing girl. my friends, if i can even call them that, share stories with me, boast all over several networking platforms, so on, and at one point, admittedly i would be jealous. but i'm not. things that once made me want to wake up, that feeling of staring at the clock for hours and hours, counting down for whatever purpose and/or activity i was excited for, or in general, over all hyperness. 

i don't find joy, or peace for that matter, in anything anymore. i can't sleep without suffering from horrendous night terrors. i can't shower without thoughts of drowning myself. in fact, i've only showered once in two weeks. i can't eat, i don't think i deserve too. there are literally thousands of women, **mothers with kids**, families, hard working men, and animals who starve on a daily basis, who actually need food, who actually fight for their life. i never have an appetite. i've all but dehydrated myself at this point. there are days where i'll go without drinking even a single glass of water, or anything else for that matter. all i do is sit in my room. i'm sleeping in 1-2 hour intervals a few times throughout the day. i sit in the same chair, doing the same thing, hurting more and more. i don't even take my medicine anymore, the idea of swallowing all of them is too tempting. 

i can't focus on anything around me, i can't think to save my life. my thoughts are completely scatterbrained most days, and my mind is foggy nearly all day, every day. i try to just ""go with the flow."" but even then, i find myself growing more distant and struggling just to grasp onto one small focal point in general. i find myself forgetting things easily, more often than i'd like. i find myself doing activities i don't even remember starting, most of the time it's something like getting into bed, changing clothes, and other small, measly tasks, but still, i'm usually doing it without realizing it. sort of like i'm daydreaming while doing it. its not a bad thing, i don't think, but it's still bothersome to me.

i don't know why i am that way that i am. i have a lot of problems with me, sure. but is that really a reason to feel such dark, depraved and intense thoughts to take my own life? to follow down a path of severe and violent self destruction...?

a little insight on that, i have an arachnoid cyst on my brain, that sits behind my right retina. i've had 9 brain surgeries, 9 operations in just a decade of my life that has already planned however long i have left. i'm young, i'm 22. and i can't even enjoy most activities that anyone else my age can. i can't jar my head, i can't over exert my body and pull at the shunt inside me, and i can't handle much damage to myself. so, i'll never get to enjoy roller coasters, concerts, amusements parks in general, or anything else pertaining to loud sounds and/or vibrations. because of this health issue, i also can't control my bladder well, if at all, which has limited me to, yes, being fully diaper dependant all my life. i have a weight limit of what i can lift/carry, being 5-10 pounds. my vision is terrible, seeing as the cyst sits on my right retina as well, and the hearing in my right ear is awful. i can't drive, which also leads to feelings of insecurity, and lonliness. just another thing i can't do.

i also have autism, aspergers, to be clear. i can't communicate or openly express my emotions in a timely, healthy manner. sometimes at all. this post alone has taken about 2 1/2 hours to think out, and a lot of speech to text was involved. my thought process is slowed, drastically, and people often find frustration or irritation when having to repeat themselves to me, or explaining in a simpler way. i google alot of words, and ask how to correctly use things in a sentence. 

i have a handful of people who i would say **might**, big key word there, care if i was to off myself. sure, i get the same lecture every day, fine after time, ""it gets better."" ""you'll find someone."" ""don't give up."" but will i? maybe one day it *will* get better, but in almost 23 years, (my birthday is less than a month away) i've not accomplished anything at all. and i don't think i will. i build unhealthy and unwanted attachments to people because all i do is sit and stare at my phone all day, and i become clingy, i respond too fast, usually just looking stupid because i can't properly communicate, and end up chasing people away. so i guess, is life really worth it? can i *truly* disappear, without leaving behind the pain of my suicide to those ""loved"" ones?

"planning for end of julyhaving an exceptionally hard time(lol as usual) lately and i feel like im going to end up drinking myself to death by the end of the month. it feels sort of like a long time coming and im not even really sad about it, just relieved. ive had self harming tendencies since 11 and was hospitalized for the first time at 13. ive been 7 times since i turned 18(currently 23). these experiences have left me extremely mistrustful of doctors + i have no insurance so my borderline personality disorder is currently completely untreated. i live alone and do not have contact with my family aside from my mother who is 17 hours away, who has very little interest in me and often finds me frustrating if i dont project a put together person for her. i have a handful of acquaintances and one or two close internet friends, but do not have any traditional irl friends really. i work 40+ hours a week and am financially on my own; the type of job is unimportant but i find it physically and emotionally exhausting. i am prone to disordered eating and it causes me a great deal of anxiety, and i abused substances for years to help mask the pain. i decided in may to get sober and did for 50 days before a very bad relapse. i have not been able to stop it and the substance abuse + disordered eating are fueling eachother in a really nasty cycle. im trying to stop it but there's a great deal of shame and sadness and absolutely overwhelming depression thats come with them that is making things very difficult. i do not know if being sober made me feel better; i felt different, but the disassociation and depression were still very present to my disappointment. i feel very little desire to continue trying. so much of my energy goes to just going through the motions of work and the rest goes to trying to recover. i feel terrible. i am so alone and have no support. i try to meet people but it takes up so much energy i dont have and often ends up encouraging me to drink/partake in substance use. i dont feel like i have gotten anything out of my life in a long time and somehow it has hit a new low. i dont think it would take a lot to kill me. i am not religious, i am indifferent towards how my death would make others feel. people speak of improvement and things like that but they never seem to credit the amount of pain and isolation i work through everyday and how much it has taken from me and my ability to keep going. i dont know what to do, ill just post on this reddit i guess. w/e. have a nice day.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"after taking care of my mentally ill mom and sister for a couple years as a kid they’ve gotten better but i feel like dying.i’m sorry that this is long. tl;dr is the title.

my mom and my sister (5 years older, i’ll call her s) have a long list of mental illnesses. my mom has mostly recovered and my sister is getting better but around 2014-2016 when i was 11-13, things were really bad. without going into to much details, my parents filled for divorce and some other things happened which broke my mom. she attempted suicide. she ended up in the hospital for two weeks and was diagnosed with a stack of mental illnesses and was put on meds. she came home and s and i basically took care of her but s wasn’t doing well and was getting skinnier and skinnier. my mom was cutting a lot, i walked in on her a few times and she didn’t even notice me. so much blood was dripping from her arm, so damn much blood. what is an 11 year old supposed to do when he sees this? i had no clue what to do so i ignored it. 

my sister was doing worse and worse and was eventually diagnosed with an eating disorder as well as a couple other things and put in a hospital. of course this didn’t help my mom’s situation and the cutting got so much worse and she was sleeping all day because of her meds. after my sister got out of the hospital, she tried to commit suicide a few times. for quite a while there was daily screaming matches between s and my mom. one would start to get upset about something then the other would get upset because the first person was upset and it would just keep escalating, all while i sat there and pretended it wasn’t happening. i’d see fresh bandages on my mom’s arm and ignore it, i’d hear my mom or my sister crying in her room and ignore it, i’d see my sister secretly working out and ignore it. i though that bringing attention to it would make them upset so i didn’t. they forgot my birthday that year.

at this point, i, a 12 year old, was now taking care of my mother, my older sister and myself. i made all of my own food, cleaned up the house, got myself to and from school, and made sure my mom and my sister were both breathing when i came home. i took care of them but at the same time i ignored what was happening to them and i ignored how i felt. i thought that i couldn’t cause any problems or voice how i felt because i was worried that if i wasn’t okay then everything would fall apart so i became the rock, the person that they didn’t have to worry about. i was so focused on making sure that i ignored how i felt that i stopped feeling anything. after a few years, they’ve both slowly gotten better but i’m stuck. you could ask me how i’m feeling right now and i wouldn’t know the answer, let alone how to express it. i’m numb except for the occasional time i’m angry. other than that i feel nothing. i’m empty. 

i’m probably missing a lot of events and stuff because don’t remember much from the past few years but some times the stuff i do remember gets stuck in my head. i still don’t like to go out with friends and i don’t even have real friends because i still put on that facade but i try have friends because i feel like i have to be okay and people that are okay have friends. i just stay in my room while my family hangs out with my mom’s boyfriend and his daughter. i don’t care about school because i feel like i won’t even make it to university but i still try to do school work because my mom yells at me and gets really upset and calls me lazy if i don’t. 

everyday i think about how much better everything would be if i was dead but i feel like a coward because i haven’t done it yet. there are two reasons i haven’t killed my self yet: 
1. attempting suicide is something my mom and s would do and i want to be nothing like them. 
2. slitting your wrists and taking pills have too high of failure rates, there are no tall buildings around me and i don’t have access to a gun. those are starting to feel like they’re not good enough reasons to keep living. i know i’m depressed but i hate admitting it because of what my mom and s being depressed did to me. i’m just so done with every thing and i don’t even know why i’m writing this.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"a final, humble, plea.tldr at bottom, but it really lobotomies the story of my situation.

most of my life i've been completely miserable. i don't really know why, i just always feel alone, even with my best of friends at times. in high school i thought i was a complete loser...even as i walked off the field being crowned homecoming king. i always felt like an idiot even though i walked in late to my act without a calculator or a god damn clue and wound up with a 31 and used that to segue my way into a full ride scholarship, not to bad for an idiot i thought. i got to school and got heavy into drugs. they made me happy. they were not to be my ultimate problem though. that would be my parents.

they are divorced, have been since i was 4 weeks old. dads rich, moms poor, lived with mom, visited dad, that old story.

i am at msu in my second semester, spring 2010. a bad lsd trip has convinced me to profess my hidden/repressed feelings for my best friend. she makes me feel like no body else can or will. let me rephrase this again, more clearly; the only times in my adult life that i have been happy, were because this person, and this person alone, was simply there, talking to me, and genuinely caring that i existed.  she feels the same towards me, and i get to spend the greatest time of my life with her. things are great. i'm getting off drugs, im happy, truly happy, and at peace with myself and others for the first time in my life. fast forward one month. i get sick.i have to go home on medical leave, we end up taking a break, mutually, i'm so sick i can't leave the bed. the doctors say its mono. i cry in front of my mom over my loss of my new found happiness and love and she sends me to a psych ward. i get out 3 days later. i see a psych, get put on every medication you can name, get my sanity and mind pushed through zaps, loops, to the very edge. i get back to school in the fall. things between me and the only girl i will ever love (20 since none come close) questions my sanity and is seeing someone. i drink heavily and fail. get pulled out of school by dad. at this point he was running my finances, paying my bills. i thought he had control of my tuition grant. nope, he just forged my name and lied, forcing me to come home, and go to community college for the past year and work for him full time, because he knows i don't have the will to do anything about it anymore.

my mom tried to kill herself last year. luckily i was home, and with my encyclopedic pharmacology knowledge i knew i could stabilize her long enough until the emt got there, she ended up totally fine. she hated me for it. he wanted her friend to save her. her friend never showed up, or if she did, it would have been much too late. a month after that i had to sleep outside. my mother, the one i saved, was going to press assault charges, for yelling at 1am when i woke up to her screaming at my poor crying sister balled up on the kitchen floor ""you are not sending my sister to the nut house and fucking her life up like you did mine because you are tired of being a mom"". she called her bf crying saying i was going to hit her then 911 and said out now. had fun explaining to dad why i was leaping on the lawn o dad when he picked me up for work.

oh yea, and those psych ward and psych visits? my mom hid the bills from me. my credit is shit and i'm still in debt. i honestly should have watched the bitched choke on her vomit. i'd be happier too, yea i'm fucked in the head, but you would be too if your mom left you with a babysitter that just locked you in the hallway closet screaming for fucking hours.

so here i am. i got my own apt and car now. most if not all my friends have abandoned me, or ignor me, the girl of my dreams is now my long distance ex girlfriend i will never get over, and i haven't felt a happy or non-alone moment since i left college freshman year. i wake up every day wondering what i did to deserve this. i look at me, and my mom. i try to do the right thing every day, my mom throws m under a bus for a hundred bucks. she owes me her life and she fucking hates me. she's evil and does nothing but wrong, used that suicide attempt to guilt trip her new husband to the altar and is on her honeymoon in the virgin islands now. me? the one responsible for letting her have all that? what good karma reward do i get? to wake up every day crying. take orders from my fucked up family, at their ass backwards company, doing a job that anyone lse would get paid 6x the amount, but i get minimum wage to make web pages, owners manuals build machines, order parts, find new, cheaper parts, fix the network, all shit these old, technologically impaired ppl cannot do without huge outsourcing costs.

here's the icing on the shit cake of my life. the girl i keep talking about visited over spring break. it was great to see her again and talk. it was kinda awkward, but in a good sense, if that even makes sense. anyway, i get to saying how after ll this fucking shit i'll finally be able to get back on track and to school in the fall. well fuck my face, she is moving back here in the fall to do her internship at our old high school. fan. fucking. tas tick.


now, i'm a logical man, i know there is probably no one who gives a fuck to read all that, and i dont blame you, you got your own problems and that shit is depressing, so let me try to tldr this, because i need help so bad reddit, and i've gone to th best, and the rest, it's up to you and me. this ldr is a gross oversimplification but,

tldr: i was forced fom the love of my life by my parents, and i will never find anyone close to her, or get over her. i may significantly alter my long term life goals if i can still get her back, but i don't even know how she really feels now. she's the only person/thing that ever made me feel happy, or loved,or wanted, or like i fit in. she's the only reason i wake up and go through hell every day, crying, in complete agony. without the hope of her, i'd kill myself right now. i know how wrong that i, but it's true, and no amount of drugs, legal or not, therapy, anything, has been able to change that, no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i want it to. please help me not be that crazy guy that kills himself over a girl that doesn't want him reddit, idk if that's the case, but it may be, i'm so alone, just, please help me :(",suicide,suicide,1.0

i know all of you in this subreddit probably know the feeling.

it's been over two years since my last job as an accountant. i left it because i felt it was holding me back from getting my cpa degree. i didn't really left it. i just allowed myself to drift towards being fired and payed a good severance package.

i left my girlfriend at the same time too for more or less the same reason.

i don't honestly know what i've been doing for the past two years. mostly drinking and trying/failing to study i guess.

i feel utterly alone, guilty and ashamed. i know my whole career is over (not that i ever cared much about it anyway) i feel i wasted all this time and that i have nothing to show for it.

today i received a present from a friend because my birthday is getting near. i can't believe people still call me out of the blue to hang out with me and everything. it seems is fun to be around me i guess.

i won't do anything stupid. i know a lot of people care about me.

tomorrow i'm taking one of the 7 tests i still need for my degree and i know i'll most likely fail.

then i cut three small lines on my bicep, stupidly below the t-shirt line. i don't know why but watching it bleed felt really really good. it bled a lot. it didn't really hurt that much and i cleaned the cuts with antiseptic. that stung a bit. i washed the blade (with antiseptic again) and put it in a tissue in an old wallet and hid it on my wardrobe for next time. i'm sitting here looking at my handiwork and tbh i can't wait to do it again. i completely forgot about the pain. i know this isn't healthy but if i can't kill myself to stop the pain i can do this at least. they're only little cuts and i doubt they'll even scar. i'll do it somewhere else next time that can be hidden easily. i don't really care about scars since i made myself a deal that if i don't have a reason to live by twenty i'll just end it despite being a pussy. i probably need help but it's not like anyone around me really gives two shits. idek why i bothered hiding it nobody will give a fuck lol.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my parents don't let me do homeschoolinggoing to background, i've never given my parents a reason to worry about my studies or social life. literally, i've been doing everything on my own and been successful in it. i entered a local elite lyceum for free just because my knowledge were enough, which i accumulated working on my own. the thing is that i'm mostly studying. it's not bad since it's what i want, but the lyceum didn't meet the expectations. at the lessons we mostly sit and doing nothing, being insulted and humiliated by teachers along with it. this is because i'm from quite a poor country where teachers are mostly +60 and don't get paid well. this is why the high school grades are often left with no tuition at all. so we come to school, sit there up to 4 pm and go back with tones of homework that contains of just mere something to your copybook, since teachers don't care. but at the same time we're exposed to anything the teachers want to. if they want to beat us on the back because we're sitting the wrong way, they can. if they want to choose a random weak student who can't reply and start telling him that he's worthless and perhaps will just die after school, they can. i'm not touched by them as i will defense myself, but i can't stand seeing this to others everyday. everyone's self-esteem is ruined, i'm being told that i'm no use and do nothing every day, and after that i gotta go home and find motivation to do something, to convince myself that it would change things for my future. 

however i get lesser time for my study. i come home in the evening, exhausted from sitting and doing mechanical work like writing that doesn't have any intellectual value. and i have +5 more hrs of my own studies so that i can enter the university in two years. needless to say about other activities, i hardly have time to exercise so that my spine doesn't hurt much. at night i have a little time to chat with my friends or finally read something. but it leads to constant lack of sleep which is gradually killing me. besides, we're studying the same way on saturday, so i only get one weekend which i spend doing hw and cleaning.

my mom knows how hard it is for me, she sees me coming home sad and dead everyday. the worst is that i waste my life. i'm studying five languages at the moment, but with school i only steal some time when a teacher doesn't see, so that i can do my own stuff. i also prepare for university math &amp; physics exam, which is way harder than anything else. 

 i was preparing her for this talk for a while, i was making an image of my school for her as something which only wastes my time and abilities. it's not about a bad ('not enough') education, it's about a lack of it. but that very day i told her about the idea of homeschooling, i had a breakdown. i just silently cried, as i don't do it on public, but i felt empty. empty of any motivation if the things would keep going the way they were. my mom said that i'm simply trying to skip a problem. everyone in her family was attending school, so should i (i only have 1,5 years left). she was saying that if i can't cope with such a little thing, then i can't cope with life and i'm a failure that is not able to make it. she started to say that i have a bad behavior, since i don't talk much to my family or don't suggest my help. she said that i'm a fool if i assume that i'm getting tired, since school is not a work. she said i'm a lazy bitch who doesn't want to do stuff. 

i know it sounds dry for now and i know that some people's sufferings are not even comparable, but i'm just empty and full of bad stuff i can't deal with now. i spent two nights with no sleep and two days just studying. i came back to school and heard humiliating things from teachers. i cut my wrist but got scared of a lot of blood and dizziness so i stopped it with a rope. in the last two months i lost six kilos because i throw when i get stressed. 

i just don't know what to do so far. if i could do homeschooling, i would study my grade's program, which we simply don't do at school. i would have time for my studied, i would prioritize. i could master my languages in these 1,5 year. i could be healthier and not feel a constant pain, shiver and lack of sleep. i could eat normally, but not early in the morning and late in the night. i could only enhance my motivation, otherwise not suppressing them with everyday humiliation. but i'm killing the only time remained. 

i don't know how long i can last. i have very little belief that my effort will bring me to a better life. kinda all.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"no one care about me since i don't have money. why am i even here...i had been suicidal for a long time and felt better in the last year. until recently. recently i lost a pet (it was a 2 days old baby) my boyfriend stopped receiving his disability pay and can't go back to work. this mean we only have 1 salary. i cannot afford my meds, no one can pay them for me. i even got throught a bottle of my meds that expired 2 years ago. i am getting tired of eating soups and pasta it has been like that for a while. the tought of eating the same stuff again make me cry.

i tought i was getting better with ergotherapy but i learned the insurance will cut this and the shrink soon because they believe i don't need them and they can save money.

one of the only joy i had in the last year has been the gifting sub and helping others out in various subs. it made me think that the good i spread would turn around. i even sent someone money to pay for the dr appointment and they said they would send me a little something each months. nothing big but like a chocolate or elastic for my hairs. all i asked for in the exchange accepted. i have no news of aby package but still felt like i helped. over the months i sent a lot of stuff but now that i have financial issues no one even talk to me anymore or only briefly if prompted. i don't want gofts just to be as loved as when i had the money to send stuff.

i tried asking for help for the food on /r/assistance and for someone to talk to in /r/depression but all i get are downvote on assistance and absolutely nothing in depression. people ignore me like it always has been.

no one care about me and i am starting to wonder why i am even here. i feel like there is no point of trying anymore. the only thing that made me smile are subs that only wanted my money. now that i am broke i am useless and no one would miss me.

"bad thoughts.i'm 25 years old. i've always been a somewhat solitary and introverted person, but in the last year or so i feel that i have really hit rock bottom. there is no love in my life. the very few close friends that i have are in the process of outgrowing me as they establish their careers and get married. i just got back from a night out with them where i might as well have been invisible. i haven't been able to relate to anyone in my family in years. i just spend a lot of time with negative thoughts in my head and have been unemployed for about 2 years. i can't connect or look anyone in the eye when i'm out in public and on the off chance that i even try, the self doubt that i experience is crippling. i feel best immediately after the runs that i go on, but those moments are fleeting.

my living situation is disfunctional. it's just me and my mom in a big house, so i at least get some privacy. i try to tell myself that it's her fault how my life has turned out and i hate myself for it. even the most insignificant interactions that i have with her just piss me off irrationally. i never had a stable social life as i was growing up. i had 4 older siblings who all moved out for college by the time i was cognizant of the fact that my mom and dad never spoke to each other. i was forced to switch schools several times and i never recovered. since then my circle of friends has gotten increasingly smaller and it's gotten to the point where i just don't trust people with my feelings anymore. i know that it sounds extremely petty for me to be so fixated on something that many people face at some point, but if i had to pick a moment in time... i spend a lot of time just browsing the facebook pages of people that i knew in high school and seeing how practically everyone i've ever known has surpassed me in every way imaginable unless they're a corpse. tonight i deactivated my fb account out of frustration, but i have a feeling that this will just add to my isolation.

the world is just passing me by. i don't think i accomplished a single thing all last year and it's fucking depressing. i'm currently in the process of finishing my education at a fifth tier college. when i think about my options for success, which at this point would just be not living in a basement, the one thing that always comes to my mind is enlisting in the military and getting myself killed in a pointless war to spare my family from the shame of a suicide. most people would probably tell me to just man the fuck up, and i realize that my issues are 100% mental. it's just impossible to get anything done when i feel worthless all the time.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my life has become a nightmaretnis will be a long read but i'm very grateful for those who will read it. i'm going to start this off by saying i've never been a happy person. i've always seeked solace in philosophy &amp; drugs. i've done numerous drugs to try and help me. lsd, shrooms, tons of benzos &amp; opiates, mdma, but they always only help temporarily. i've been depressed. always. i can't remember the last time i was happy. i can't remember the way i was before it ever came into my life. but life somehow started looking up for me, i had a well paying job, drugs, close friends, a girlfriend, a car, and just my freedom. i had everything i've ever wanted in life. i wasn't happy but i was content and had a hope for my future.

until two weeks ago where i made the worst decison of my life ; that was driving when i was fucked up. i was coming home from a day filled with popping pills and smoking with friends, &amp; i made the most selfish, stupid decision of driving under various substances. i swerved and my wheel came off the road, lost traction and pummeled me into a pickup truck. i was on the highway going 60. my car got totalled. ambulance had to bust the windows in the back because my car flipped to get me out.i was fine besides hurting my neck and some major bruises. but i admitted in the emergency room that i was messed up &amp; under various drugs. i got arrested and charged for wreckless driving, dui, &amp; plenty of drug charges they found in my car after. i'm failing all my classes. i've always had a great gpa, a really good act score to get me into a decent college with a nice scholarship but ive ruined that future. besides losing my future, friends, job, car, money, freedom, &amp; my reputation. i put two other people in the hospital. 

one of them is a father. has kids. &amp; he's been in the hospital since. he has a broken neck &amp; in a lot of pain. i couldn't imagine what i would do to some fucker who almost killed my mom because of their dumbass decisions. ive been living with the guilt since. that i almost killed another person, almost made some kids live without their father. i'm the lowest person and i honestly feel like i don't deserve to live. i wish i never wore my searbelt, that i was killed in the crash. i truly deserve it. insurance isn't going to cover any medical bills. i put myself and my mom in thousands of dollars in debt. we cant afford that. she works as a single mother, supporting three kids as a fast food manager. besides contemplating suicide daily because of living with this guilt amd regret that eats me up 24/7. ive lost everything. i've become a disgrace to my family, to society. my brother tells me daily how i should've died &amp; how much of a piece of shit i am. my dad was a drug addict who left our family at the age of 6, and my mom &amp; brother tell me how i'm far worse than him. it hurts so fucking much. all of this does. i can't bear this emotional pain. i never meant to hurt anyone in my entire life. ive always been so nice and caring to others because i know life is hard &amp; i only wish to bring good to others. but i've fucked my life up beyond repair.  

i don't see a way out of this. i don't want one. i just wish i had the fucking balls to end this guilt and misery i feel all the fucking time. i can't keep living. i don't deserve to. the only person who has a little faith in me is my girlfriend. i love this girl to death. she's the most amazing person i've ever met. shes the only one who has faith in me &amp; support me. but i can't even see her with no car. i don't have a phone to talk to her. i'm probably going to lose her too. i hate that i'm making people suffer because of my decisons. these poor people i almost killed, my family, my girlfriend, my friends. i've truly lost everything. i hope so much that i just can end it all. to stop feeling this misery. to never have to see another day. hopefully one day i will. thank you for reading.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"it took a pandemic for schools to prioritise their students and their well-being over curriculum we were told today that we'd be using binders and taking notes so that we didn't have to bring in or pay for books, and it's like, why didn't we do that all along? 


we were told that even worries that seemed absurd will be taken seriously by teachers and that they're always there to support us no matter what, and it's ok to make mistakes, and that they're something to learn from not something to fear, why wasn't that iterated to us before?


we have fairer rules and timetables, which would've been helpful even without the coronavirus.


i'm in a test year, and we were told that it will be laid out differently to reduce unnecessary study, and our futures won't suffer, and yet many students stressed and dreaded going to school and lowered their mental health because of such things, so if this was always possible, why wasn't it done? 


i am grateful that we have these policies in place, and i'm grateful for the things schools were trying to do to better their students wellbeing before the pandemic, but only now are we seeing actual radical changes in the way things are done and,

i need to be better, but i’m a shit human being. i disappoint and i let down and i flake. i just feel like the world would be better off without me, you know? 

anyway. i wrote an rant about autobiographies earlier which isn’t even close to having cohesive ideas. but i just want to say it. i know it’s repetitive and meandering and too abstract to be understood by anyone with any sense, but i want to shout these feelings into the void. i’m sorry you had to end up in the same one as i. 

on autobiographies— fuck you for thinking you matter
it is incomprehensibly arrogant to think that anyone would care about your life:
a stranger, just another of billions of billions of lives that exist ephemerally on this earth every day

— !
how dare you think that anyone cares about you and what you’ve done?
nothing you have ever done has had any meaning to anyone other than those whom you’ve directly affected. nor will it ever. 

the measure of an impactful life begins and ends with the connections one has made. nothing more, and nothing less. no one cares about your life. your thoughts, your words, your experiences. they are meaningless, and for you to think for a second that they matter is mind-bogglingly self-centered. 

i hate biographies, but my most fervent vitriol i reserve for autobiographies. anyone can write a book and pretend that those people who read about their brief, insignificant stints admire them, or value them, or even consider them as anything but a distorted mirror through which they see themselves. and to pretend that your life matters is the worst arrogance of them all. when people read about you, they don’t care about you. they don’t care about how you’ve felt, or what you’ve thought, or what you’ve done. they only see you as a vessel through which they might encounter some spark that will give meaning to their worthless lives. i do not mean for worthless to be an offensive accusation. rather, i state it as a fact. every life is just as worthless as every other. 

i read about your life story, and all i see are the ways in which you are similar to me. and i wonder if you have some value that i do not. for look at you— look at all you’ve done. and look at what i’ve done. it’s folly, i know. neither of us matters. but there is a dark, aching sting in knowing that i matter even less. is every life just as worthless as any other? the truth sits like a cold stone on the floor of my chest. i know that’s not true. i am more worthless. i don’t deserve to be here. 

and then i see the ways in which we are different. i see in you a mirror, and you reflect back at me everything i hate about myself. you highlight every shortcoming, every flaw. every idea you articulate is a reminder that i have never had an original thought. 

i hate that anyone can ever feel as though their lives are worth something. because i can’t. 



i know. i know that all we can ever do is write about ourselves. i am incapable of knowing anything else, and i don’t even have a firm grasp on that— who i am, i mean. i wish i were gone from this earth so i wouldn’t have to bear the burden of knowing how many resources i waste in my existence. i don’t deserve to be here. none of us do.

i'm lost. i'm in pain. i've literally been laid down with sickness after sickness for the past 3 weeks now and it's really starting to bring down my energy and positive attitude, not like there was much to begin with anyways but whatever.

on top of that 2 weeks ago my girlfriend's parents found out about the relationship, and she got solidly grounded. technically we should be broken up but fuck that, we're still together. but that's not even the point. i haven't been able to talk to her for over 4 days now (she doesn't have her phone on her cause punishment) and it's driving me insane. i need her so badly and i know it's not her fault but i can't help but feel a bit of misplaced resentment. i'd give anything to say a single word to her but i can't reach her at all.

but i've got a new emotion bubbling up inside me- jealousy. most of all i'm jealous of my two friends who are in the most solid relationship ever. they're so happy with each other and they get to spend time with each other and text each other stupid stuff and they're everything i wanted to be, and i used to be so happy for them because i knew they needed it but now everytime they talk about each other i'm just reminded of what a hopeless situation my own relationship has devolved into and i'm reminded of the fact that i should be this happy but i'm not.

i also feel so guilty knowing that they care so much about me and i give nothing back to them. i could literally ruin their good mood just by showing up with a sad face and now i'm so guilty about showing how i really feel because i don't want to be the thing that brings people down when they're supposed to be happy. 

on top of that i've got exam stress setting in and i should be studying but i'm too physically and mentally sick to properly prepare and now i've only got 13 days to go i'm so fucked it's not even funny.

i'm really starting to spiral back down into suicidal thoughts. i have a plan, i have easy access to the materials i need to execute my plan and if i sink any lower so help me i'll fucking do it. it's like i was never meant to feel happiness, that some higher power cursed me to live like job but without the reward at the end. i don't feel worthy of feeling happiness and love anymore, i just want to escape and start over because i cannot fucking handle all these poisonous thoughts and feelings in my head",suicide,suicide,1.0

i'm a chronic looser, for some reasons, even with good intention, i just end up lying and messing everything up.

the point of killing myself is that i can't get any help, because i lie to the doctors, so the only option left is dying.

i've had suicidal thoughts for years and i'm afraid i'm gonna do this...

"because of my nationality i can't buy bop it for some backstory, i had a bop it smash when i was like 6 or 7 that i recently found that broke, but they don't produce them anymore(i think) so i can't buy it from any store, so i tried buying it from some random guy on the internet, but the only seller sells one of those scams where they put only on the description that it's broken and nowhere else, so after almost getting scammed i tried buying it from ebay (ps: i'm not from a english speaking country so that's why that wasn't my first option) but the shipping taxes + price were like r$150(way more than 150 noodles since each noodle costs r$0,70)

so basically i can't buy my bop it smash for christmas cuz of taxes that i got just for living on the other side of the planet

i decided to buy a bop it tetris instead since it's just r$99 without taxes (i'm going to pay the taxes and my dad will pay the toy itself as a christmas gift)

everything's my fault, you know? it's not even something i say for pity anymore. i can't justifiably find a way to convince myself something might not be my fault, because as long as i'm in any way involved, i can be blamed for it in one way or another. if someone hurts me and i tell them, they'll feel guilty. they'll blame me for hurting them like that, eventually. it's my fault. it's my fault, and i deserve every bit of pain i'm in.

but i'm tired. i'm so, so, so incredibly tired and even though i know the only way for the people around me to be happy is for me to suffer in silence, i'm still tired. i need to die. that's the only way things can ever be okay for any of us; me, or my friends.

it's always been hard but at some point you realize it's always going to pass. it's always going to get easier with time because time will heal all wounds; but if my existence in itself is the issue, that's an entirely different thing altogether. i can't separate from myself. time won't make me not exist.

"this story happen long ago, i want to share it for some reason tbharound here you study 8 years in elementary school then you go highschool and study 3 years there and go to college, your grades in .highschool determines what college you go to and your grades in elementary school determines what highschool you go.
i was really good in elementary school i was the top of my class teachers loved me i had friends i grew up with, surely there were ups and downs a bit of bullying but things were pretty good, my life at home was rough my parents had a troubled marriage and they fought all the time and sometimes the fighting gets really intense.
my grades started to decline when i reached 7th grade, we started to studying advanced stuff and they were a little hard for me to understand, my mother got concerned about my grades so she decided to move me to a mildly expensive competitive private school.
things were very different and a little overwhelming, there were few foreign students and teachers i was sad for leaving my old school friends but i was positive and hopeful to make new friends and impress my new teachers but non of that happen i couldn't really make friends cuz i am a little shy and not really social and my grades were mediocre comparing to the other top students with full perfect grades, i was surprised to see the different between my level and their's, i tried to improve multiple times but i couldn't keep up with the them and eventually i gave up simply stop caring and trying.
my grades went downhill i became the bottom of my class i started to lie to my parents ""specially my controlling mother"" i forged my dad's signature on the report card few times and one time they had a parents meeting in school but my dad was busy at work and my mom said she wouldn't go cuz she is ashamed of me and on top of that i used to get bullied and teased a lot cuz i had a young baby face.
i used to go school as a escape for home but now both school and home were awful, till one day i was in the school bus still trying to fit in with the ""cool guys"" i was listening to their conversions and tried to chat with them that's where one of them looked at me and said ""what you want ass face? "" i said ""nothing just chatting a little"" he said "" mind your own business "" i said "" i just want talk a little ya know ? i just..... "" and he punched me and said "" i said mind your own business ass face!! "" 
and i just started to cry, a lot and i felt humiliated cuz i was crying in front of the girls.
everything was just awful i couldn't take it anymore and that was my breaking point, i made my decision that day i am gonna end it all i was going to end my life, i waited till it was dark and everyone went to sleep i went up to the roof of my house and was going to jump, but i was scared of dying scared that the fall might not kill me and was wondering how i am gonna explain this to my parents? "" i tried to kill my self because of kid called me ass face and punched me? "" that sounds very ridiculous.
so i had to live with pain live through this horrible life and just wait for to things get better, and eventually they did.

i can't find a job. i've been here two days, applied to probably twenty and the flow of rejection letters just keeps coming. i'm young, just 17 but i was living on my own up until december at my girlfriends mom's house in nh. 

i got kicked outta there for legal reasons (she's in the middle of a divorce and her lawyer said i had to go), and had to run home to momma who is now withholding all of my belongings and hates my guts for literally no good reason. she's always been crazy though.

so now, i'm dragging my father down financially, my girlfriend down situationally. did i mention that i fell in love with another girl states away? what a piece of work i am.

i leave nothing but destruction in my wake, there's little of this world worth anything beyond a handful of people that i constantly hurt anyways.

"my story - i probably would never do it, but it's a thought in my mindnot sure where to start, so i'll begin with the basics. i'm a 19-year-old male, living in the uk; i left school at 16 and went to a college for 2 years, finishing at 18. from here i began searching for a job. i live in a very small area and so it was very difficult to land a job. after around 6 months of trying, i finally got one. it was a very good job for someone of my age and was one that i could potentially stay at for the rest of my life.

unfortunately, i couldn’t cope with it. i have been an extremely quiet person for almost as long as i remember, all throughout school i was known as one of the quiet ones, and still now, to everyone that knows me, i am still, “the quiet one”. the job i got involved making a large amount of phone calls to people, whereby i would be asking them a lot of questions and answering a large amount of phone calls as well, where i would need to relay a lot of information back to answer the questions that they had for me. being a quiet person, this was very difficult for me to handle and the added pressure of having co-workers in the office that could all hear me having to give out all this information, whilst they know me as “the quiet one”, made it just too much for me to be able to handle and i ended up resigning after around 3-4 months as it was making me ill and keeping me up all night worrying about having to go back through it all the next day.

since this, i haven’t really made any progress towards anything. i have spoken to doctors, counselors etc, but as the issue i am having, is that i am extremely quiet, i don’t feel i am getting anything from it as i struggle to speak to people. this is probably going to sound completely ridiculous, but i struggle to speak to my own family. i rarely start a conversation with the people i am closest too and when they try and start the conversation up, i tend to give one word answers and the conversation stops there. as much as i would love to be “normal” and be able to have these social interactions with the people i am closest too, i cant and the thought of that makes me feel so stupid.

my mum is very ill right now and worrying her only makes things worse and causes her stress levels to escalate which causes her a lot of pain, even to the point were she in unable to get up.

i feel as though i am just a burden to my family as all this seems to cause issues and stress for everyone i am close too, as all they want is for me to get a job and live a “normal” happy life. i am not currently working which makes me feel even worse, but the fear of going back to a job and the whole cycle repeating itself is just too much.

like i said in the title of this post, i probably would never do it, but it's a thought in my mind. to be honest, the reason i haven’t is because of the impact it would have on my mum, as she has asked me a number of times if i would ever do it and my response has always been no.

as i don’t seem to be going anywhere, or have any drive to improve things, i just don’t know what to do, i don’t want to be a shut in anymore, but i have know idea how to even start improving anything, just thought i write my ideas down as that tends to make me feel a little better.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"""i'm a woman, of course i flirt to get what i want."" (x-post /r/mmfb)im not fucking around dude, thats an exact quote from this chick.

thats some dumbshit, right? well i'm even dumber. basically, i drove 8 fucking hours to bring her ass back to our home state when no one else would. so shes pretty much homeless for a week, staying at my place though, we end up fucking. everyone we knew had told me she had a crush on me, i brought it up and stuff anyway, we ended up having sex. all the types of sex, multiple times. 

problem though? shes still with her boyfriend. dudes a fucking loser but whatever, still, dont make me part of your cheaty affair bullshit without telling me. i aint no side bitch. but i forgave her, she did go spend a night with her bf but she came back. idk why i let her back, **oh right, im fucking retarded**, but i did. but it seemed okay, we spent a few days just doing the funest shit together, going out and.. everything yo. 

but then she finds out i told my supposed to be best friends about us and they end up telling her that i told them. she goes apeshit for some reason, cause its just a few people who cares, we've known eachother forever its not unusually to tell each other about just random shit that happens in life. but anyway, then she starts saying all this shit about how she 'never was attracted to me' in the first place, and how she felt like i ""raped her"" im not fucking joking. 

she had said herself earlier that our sex was just a break from her bf for a while. but yeah she keeps going on about how im the worst person ever, and how im such a liar (i cant stand being called a liar, quickest way to piss me off. ive never lied to her once, and i offered to back up every single word ive said with proof. it took her a while to come up with anythinggggg that i 'lied' about, and when she did it turned out to be a misunderstanding.. i explained this to her but nope im the biggest liar eve blah blah blah. but... anyway she says she never wants to see/talk to me again so. but thing is, i actually cared for her as a friend, yaknow. i had more fun doing crazy chill shit with her than i did having sex, honestly.

i know it seems a bit tame kinda but the way she worded it all really cut deep to the point where i almost wasnt so sure myself.. am i a terrible person. cause like, she seemed pretty into it, got on top, orgasmed multiple times etc, and obviously if she told me she wasnt id have stopped. that wasnt the fucking case. im not a rapist, bitch, youre just starting to regret cheating on your bf... right?

tl;dr: bitches is crazy, dont trust them hoes. that goes for the guys too. idk, fuck relationships/friendships w/e. and it hurts to say that, i wish the world wasnt really like this. shit, man.

**sw bonus:** i tried to slit my throat yesterday, before this happened. cops/ambulance came and everything. talked my way out of going to a mental hospital. only reason i was suicidal was because i was alone atm, i hate being alone. most of my friends were her friends, and all of them hate me now, except this one girl.. maybe. but still, im going to be so alone here... all of my relationships turn out to be some crazy shit like this. i feel so used all the time even though a lot of people think id be living the dream if i didnt get so attached but i do and i will and i cant help it no matter how hard i try. this chick is obviously crazy and toxic, but... i still have love for her, i still wanted to be her friend.  again, im really retarded.",suicide,suicide,1.0

it's not like i want a whole lot from life. i just want enough money to support my hobbies. something better than the second-rate college i attend because i fucked up my first opportunity. things that are quality enough to last longer than 6 months after i buy them. student loan forgiveness. being able to travel once a year. that's it, if i had that, i wouldn't ask for anything else ever. hell if i didn't live in america i wouldn't even own a car, 4000 dollars back in my pocket.

and yet i can't even find a minimum wage job because to get any sort of job here in my town you have to know people here. my family are outsiders here in this tiny joke of a town. and i can't move anywhere without having money to begin with. stuck, i'm stuck. the only way to go is down, 6 feet under to be precise. even the nearest town would take out a third of my paycheck to drive there every week because it's over a half hour away.

how can i be happy without money if my hobby is computers? i don't take joy from much else. maybe hookah but that costs money i don't have too. i hate exercising, i went for a brisk walk the other day and i felt worse afterwards, especially since i had to look at this shit town i hate so much and the shitty people in it. why do the things i like to do have to cost so much money?

why am i still alive? i don't want to be here anymore. i have no energy or motivation. every day is a chore. other people want me alive for some strange reason but i just want to die and the people who can actually do something to help me aren't the ones who care

edit:

i think about suicide every single day. even when things seem okay (like when my friends paid for me to come to chicago with them for a convention) something sets me off and makes me feel that way, or i remember what life is really like.

although i used to be depressed i wasn't really suicidal until maybe last year. all i see anymore is suffering, and the people who aren't suffering are just rubbing it in my face whether they're trying to or not.

and it seems like no matter what anyone says to me it doesn't help, i need something to change but i really just don't see a way out of my situation. i need to leave this town but there's just no way to do that",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i’ve completely given uphello. i’m 15, female, and have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 5 years. 

my story is pretty pathetic, and is mostly just me whining while other people have it so much worse. but for those of you who think it’ll help, i’ll do my best to explain. sorry, it may be a bit long. 

when i was 10 years old and going into 5th grade, i was entering middle school at the same time (grade 5 was the first year of middle school for people in my area). i went to an elementary school that held students that could go to either of the 2 middle schools close by. all of my close friends went to the other middle school, leaving me with only my older friend and neighbor at the time. she took a turn for the worst, and began bullying me to look cool in front of her friends. on top of that, i was bullied by people in my class for being weird and having no friends. when i tried to reach out for help, my parents told me to suck it up &amp; get over it, while my school counselor ignored me. my teachers were also fed up with my drop in grades and lack of focus in class. every night, i would begin to fantasize about running into the kitchen and stabbing myself with a chef’s knife. i had no idea what suicide was. 

after 6 months, i eventually made a friend, and began to recover. 

at the end of my 7th grade year, we were planning a long-distance move. i wasn’t too worried, and made sure to watch my mental health very carefully. 

i made friends very quick in my new school, and was happy for the first few months. then it all went south again. 

my family was staying with my grandparents until we could get a place of our own again, and they would somehow find a way to tear apart everything that kept me sane. it felt like i was constantly being watched and judged, and if i ever made a single step out of line, they would turn my whole family against me. it was hell. 

after a year, we moved out into our own place, but this required changing schools again, so i had to say goodbye to my friends again. 9th grade was a horrible year for me, where i just felt depressed all the time. now, i’ve been harming since january, and have nothing left to live for. i’m looking for any way out, but there’s no active railroads close by, no harmful medications for me to od on, and no rope to go hang myself with. i’m completely trapped. 

i’m looking for someone who can just tell me i’m not crazy. but i don’t need anyone to try and talk me out of it. it doesn’t get any better. i’ve lied to myself for too long. people will pretend to care as long as you’re standing right next to them, but the second there is some way to bring you down, they will not hesitate to hurt you instead. can anyone relate to me?",suicide,suicide,1.0
"one time i nearly died (from bathroom shenanigans) last year, i was in 8th grade. so i think we all know how stupid 8th graders are. anyway, so i'm heading into the girls bathroom because i needed to go, i walk in, and see a stall already in use.

in a single moment i have the ""greatest"" idea to say:

""i'm bouta take the biggest shit in this bitch.""

....out loud, to whoever was in the stall.

but i decided not too.

and then my science teacher, who was my next class, walked out. 

she's a really nice teacher. one of the greatest ones ever. but considering how small and prestigious my school was, i would have been in a lot of trouble if i went through with the joke. ah, the joys of going to a gifted magnet school run by liberal lgbtq+ supporters.

possible tw idk how this sub works —- in the past few weeks, i’ve become very suicidal and was planning to do it today, wed 10th june. but after months of being alone my close friend said we could meet and it was great, stopped me wanting to ykw, but i had a major panic attack with her and with social distancing that’s hard :/ 

if i’m honest, i am very fucked up, i am suffering with anxiety, depression and ptsd (caused by this same very close friend trying to sui**** but i found her). i am now being effected by the pt** daily and sometimes several times in a day leading to several panic attacks and it’s really fucking me up... i don’t want to kill myself because it fucked me up when she almost did, so i know that i will mess her up again after i spent 2 months helping her partially recover and i don’t want to make her bad again. 

i am scared of myself and the help isn’t coming after being diagnosed and waiting for so long, it’s getting worse and worse and the thoughts are coming more intense. tw - tonight i drank a lot of alcohol and took some k, hoping that i would become very dissociated and end up choking but here i am, i guess i’ve built up too much tolerance recently.

"i rick-rolled one of my high school teachers long story short, i (19f) graduated high school last summer and started college last fall. my high school teachers were honestly just a bunch of unreasonable people who never gave a damn about our wellbeing so i decided to bother them. i made a fake email account pretending to be an annoying freshman wanting to impress the teachers with a youtube video she made about her learning experiences. i sent the link to several of my teachers through their work emails and one of them actually fell for it and replied back saying ""there seems to be something off with the link you sent me. perhaps try sending it again? preferably with your full name and id details. thanks 😊.""",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0
"after 6 weeks meeting psychiatrist i feel worse than evertried different antidepressants. either they make it worse, or they make it worse plus ridiculous side effects or they doing absolute nothing.

  


now i feel so bad, it's somehow even funny. i thought i reached already the most worst. but guess what, there is no limit.

  


apart from antidepressants i got xanax, zolpidem and lorazepam. not sure anymore which combination of that shit gives me at least a little relief. in the best case i get tired and can sleep a few hours. but then when i wake up. wow. amazing. anxiety in full force.

  


i wonder for what is good to feel that bad. wtf is wrong with my mind?

  


i guess it was just another bad decision to start a therapy. actually it's amazing how many bad decisions one (me) can do in a row. it's completely against any rules of probability. whatever i do, it gets worse. but it's ok. a statistically outlier.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"this year was a very fucked up year but i learned somethings that teenagers gotta know before passing this difficult phase of life so, here is my *2021 guide for dumb teenagers* 1- the first thing you gotta know is that you are alone. and you’ll be alone forever. doesn’t matter if you have a girlfriend or friends, you’ll still be alone forever. the only thing you need to realize is how to deal with this. being alone is the best thing in the world and now i recognize that. be happy with your own company.

2- grades. “oh, i got an a so i’m smarter then you” “son, if you don’t get an a you’ll be grounded”. that’s bullshit. grades are just numbers based on an exam of a determined subject so they cannot measure if youre smart or not. you have other qualities like other people and be proud of that! it’s not a grade that’s going to tell you who you are.

3- school. yeah guys, school is such a toxic place. students are extremely cruel and you have to fake who you really are, otherwise you’ll be bullied. the only thing i have to say is that it’s just a phase. you are in school just to study, nothing else so fuck them. be yourself. hatters will hate and yeah, i don’t fucking care cuz even jesus had haters so fuck it. ( also, if someone is trying to copy your personality or style, just remember that every good movie has its pirated copies 😎) 


4- just live. it seems difficult but it’s not. you’ll fall, you’ll get up, you’ll cry, you’ll be happy, you’ll be scared and it’s normal! that’s why life is amazing. so get up from this bed and live. do wrong shit, or right shit, idc,  if you knew how quickly you’ll be forgotten when you die, you wouldn’t stop doing everything you dream thinking about what others think.

i graduated 10th grade last year, so i should have around 17 credits. i am currently in a ""fast track"" program so i can graduate earlier. 

turns out, they cut my credits in half when i joined the fast track program and each class i do in the program is only .5 credits.

i currently have 11.5 credits

i've done 12 classes this school year ( i take roughly 3 classes at once)
i've finished 8 of those 12
i should have enough credits to graduate if the classes that normally give 1 credit actually gave 1 credit in the fast track program

like geometry is 1 credit normally, but .5 credits in the programthey also took away credits i earned in a different state because ""they dont have that here"" (i had 14.5 credits in 9th grade in new york because of mcjrotc and a couple double credit classes, but they took off the mcjrotc credit because my school doesnt have an rotc class and halved my double credit classes, some only giving .5 credits now)

however 5 days ago she wrote about demi lovato’s tour bécasse she’s going to it and she was so happy. last week i invited her home and she seems happy and confident about her life.

i know she broke with her boyfriend because he cheated on her, let her dream about a future together, then going to his other girl. she had been cheated on a first time two years ago and then attempted suicide. but her family send her to the hospital and i went to see her (it was my birthday and she called me the day before i visited her).
last month, she was sad about her (ex-)boyfriend and i tried to comfort her. she told me she won’t tried to harm her, because she didn’t want to go back to the hospital.
i thought she felt better. she found an internship that seemed to interest her, she was going to move out with her sister (she lived with her boyfriend before the breaking-up but now she couldn’t afford a place for her alone).

now i don’t know what she’s doing and i want to help her... i ask her sister but she doesn’t know too (they were going to move out this week, so she would see her later). and i don’t even know why i came here to ask for help...

"i did an experiment with the placebo effect as i was going up to my bedroom, my sister took my pillow (i have two pillows) because hers was “uncomfortable”. now, that pillow that she took is extremely comfortable and she felt a lot happier with it she said. 

i took the pillow back and she started to get very grumpy. she threw her pillows on the floor and started mumbling some stuff that i couldn’t hear. she became extremely upset over the pillow.

because she is young, i thought it would be interesting to do an experiment on her because she doesn’t think a lot. she just does stuff. i changed the pillow covers so she had my cover and i had hers.

i then gave it back. she seemed delighted and started blabbering about how comfortable it was and how the other pillow hurt her neck whereas this one was perfect. she thought that it was the same pillow that she took from me whereas in reality, it was the pillow she was complaining about.

she is happily snoring and i have no intention of ever telling her about it.

"tik tok isn't that bad before i get downvoted to hell, hear me out. feel free to discuss this in the comments. sorry if this is a bit incomprehensible, english isn't my first language.

i know that people on this site have had horrible experiences with tik tok, like getting hair shaved, &gt;!pedophiles!&lt;, etc etc. but i'd like to remind you that, just like reddit or any other site, tik tok has separate communities (art, povs, fandom, etc). i'd like to turn your attention to the two biggests separate communities (in my opinion) are straight/gay tik tok. let me show you the difference.

half naked people dancing? **straight tik tok.**

history lessons that school doesn't teach due to homophobia and transphobia? **gay tik tok.**

romanticizing abusive relationships? **straight tik tok.** 

how to make earrings out of almost anything? (and i mean almost anything. i've seen someone with monster high dolls earrings.) **gay tik tok.** 

&gt;!pedophilla and sexualization of minors?!&lt; **straight tik tok.**

content that might save lives? **gay tik tok.**

yes, i am aware that not everyone on straight tik tok promotes toxic behavior and that there are some people on gay tik tok that are a bit yikes. but so are people on this platform. i guess what i'm trying to say is to choose who you surround yourself with. this may be a bit biased, seeing that i'm trans and bs around on gay tik tok, but my point still stands. 

also some people pretend to be cities, colours, and food on tik tok, and i find that very cute :).

"how to save my friend and her baby's life.i have a friend who i have known for about 16 years. i really care about her a lot and i really care about her 3 year old daughter. 
my friend has been going insane for the past two years, caused by i do not know what. she literally believes that the government has installed microchips in her body that stimulate her brain and her ovaries and that by night they remotely rape her while during the day they tell her to kill herself with her daughter. 

i don't think i have to explain any further the direness of this situation. 

what is the best, most effective way i can go about calling the authorities to have her placed in a mental hospital so that she can get the help she needs while her daughter stays with the father or grandparents?

i love this woman so much and i do not want anything to happen to her, but for goodness sake she  is potentially a threat to her daughter and herself, not to mention she is so depressed, lonely, and terrified constantly and she needs serious help to bring her back to normalcy. i've always admired her, but it has literally only started happening in the last couple of years that she has been this way. she is 29.

"""the timing would be awful...""we have our first family vacation camping trip next week. the following week our childhood friend is finally tying the knot with his lady &amp; as a result my husband &amp; i will finally have some long overdue alone time for a few days. 

""the timing would be awful,"" is the only thing that stops me from attempting this past week. but what happens when its not any more? what if these fucking trips i'm doing all the packing &amp; preparing for don't do anything to bring me out of this funk? i start putting it off for my brother &amp; cousin's birthdays? i put it off for my own? and then thanksgiving &amp; the holidays after? 

i'm sick of it. 

i get spit at, kicked, hit, pissed &amp; shit on by my toddler kids regularly. neither of them nap any more so my only ""me time"" is what i can spare crying while i wash dishes after they're finally asleep at night. my husband works so much that it feels like all our interactions are over the phone when he has a break or at 4 in the morning when he's finally home &amp; wants to have sex. he's probably feeling affection starved but i'm so fucking exhausted. i'm so worn down. i don't even feel human any more. 

i'm just some robot named, ""mom.""

i make the schedules &amp; routines. constantly monitor the shopping lists &amp; appointments. arrange the meetings &amp; learning for the kids. i'm my husbands daily alarm clock &amp; snooze warning. i'm the dish washer, the wash machine &amp; dryer. i'm the answering machine &amp; reluctant secretary that fields all of our calls - most of which are for my husband. i'm the broom, the vacuum cleaner &amp; mop. i'm the garbage disposal for all the meals my family won't eat &amp; i refuse to waste. i'm the ever vigilant body guard for the kids to make sure they don't kill themselves - and that's my most human role of all.

my other friends don't get it.

they have careers &amp; parent, so why can't i do it as a stay-at-home mom? i should feel lucky i get to spend so much time with my kids. its super fortunate that, no matter what, my schedule will always match up with my husband's so i don't have to struggle as hard to make time with him. if i schedule everything, i should be able to arrange some time to work on my book. and the most maddening comment of all, ""just relax a bit.""

but i can't relax.

me relaxing means the whole system falls apart. dishes get backed up. laundry isn't done. trash &amp; food is everywhere. none of that even scratches the surface. the pure work that builds up in a single day takes, at least, a week to get back on top of. without its machine, the house falls apart &amp; then my husband says, ""tell me what you need done."" behind his back, on the fridge, is a very visible list of ten things that have to be done. at the top of that list is the one thing i've asked him to do outside of his weekly &amp; bi-weekly chores &amp; it has sat there for an entire month now. 

i'm exhausted. 

i'm tired of carrying so much. i'm sick of my things being broken because the kids found it. i'm ill everytime i have to manage the mental load of knowing what needs to happen when all anyone else has to do is open their eyes. my head is constantly pounding over the fact that at the end of the day none of them really care about me, they care about what i have to do for them. my friends only care about my society when i can smile for them &amp; tell them they're being good parents to their kids too. i'm just here because others need me &amp; i'm so fed up with it.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"checkmate.i'm writing this mostly just for the sake of writing it down. someone adviced me to do it here, so that people might actually read it. nobody knows any of this. i actually don't really wan't anybody to any of this, but let's just say thank god for the anonimity of the internet. i've left some specific details ambiguous for private reasons but it doesn't impact the story in any way.

so i'll begin with saying that i hate sob stories. absolutely hate 'em and now i hate myself for writing one. this my first attempt at reddit, seeing as it is something i'd like to know people's thoughts on and this subreddit seems fairly active so here goes.
i'm a 20 year old male living in europe (therefore please excuse my often incorrect english). i recently dropped out of university (or college whatever) because teaching history didn't turn out te be what i wanted to with my life after all. throughout all my life i never truly felt happy. for a number of reasons -- my parents divorced when i was 2 years old. this wasn't really bad as i was far too young and dumb back then to get any of that shit. things got worse when my mom got this alcoholic asshole boyfriend who used to hit her and me. this and some trouble at elementary school eventually forced me to live away from when i was 7 years old until i was about 14-15. during that period i had some better days - i had a lot of friends, people invited me to parties all the time, the girls liked me, i played in a band - it was generally just a nice time. but a lot of the time i still felt lonely. because i'm not exactly a 'normal' person with 'normal' opinions and interests. i'm the type of guy who laughs when he watches an isis beheading vid. i hate children. i fucking hate the monsters. i root for the bad guys in the movies. i think lying is always justifiable. i don't support racism because i think it's right or if it has any factual basis but i do find it soooo funny. i laugh at rape jokes, i laugh at dead baby jokes, i laugh at gore. when i see child in the street get catapulted off his bike, i laugh. i think war is good and that the world needs another good one. i don't think killing is is bad as long as you got a reason that's valid to yourself and your smart enough to get away with it. my main interests are massacres and human experiments commited during ww2, thermonuclear warfare and poisonous plants. as you can see, to most people i'm not a very likeable person. some of you might argue that a person like that deserves to feel the way the way i do; but in any case, i hope it's clear why i never could relate to anyone or anything real. i started feeling really bad: just very lonely at first, later came anxiety until i hade full blown panic attacks for no reason at all. i started cutting myself at some point and never really kicked the habit. i tried getting help for it and got a bunch of diagnoses and perscription meds but none of it really worked. i got scared of myself sometimes. and the worst thing was that i didn't have anybody to discuss these feelings with at all, because nobody understood any of it. i didn't think there was but a single person in the world like me. somehow i resigned myself to that fate. being unique isn't all that bad, i thought. i didn't think i'd ever have a wife or a family of my own because there wasn't anybody in the world who i'd like to spend my life with. i never really 'loved' anyone. sure i had girlfriends, and i 'liked' them, i thought they were sweet and interesting, but i never really loved them. they were always too naive, or boring or in some other way just... disappointing. but i didn't really care about that. some people just aren't meant for that, i thought. so i just lived like that for a time not expecting anything to come my way at all and basically just drinking my days away whenever i didn't have a job to do or something like that. now we're getting to the really pathetic part. i met a girl. fucking online. i fucking hate the idea of meeting people online (not on a dating site or any of that cringeworthy kind of shit, god forbid), it sounded to me like total bullshit -- to take in interest in somebody you haven't really met at all in your life. like i was some desperate fuck. but she was all  i'd really want: she was smart, in fact the only person whom i regard to be as smart as myself, and yes i can proudly say i'm arrogant like that; she likes the same things i do. she has the same general outlook on life that i do. we've just got so many things in common. and she is absolutely 100% batshit insane. just the way i want to be. most of you probably think to know where this is going. that it's going to be another broken-heart sob tale, but not quiet. it's not what makes it all that bad to me. you see, when i met her, and started talking to her i gradually fell madly in love with her. i haven't seen her once with my own eyes, never even heard her voice but i knew from those very first moments that if there was ever a person who i'd like to share a life with, it'd been her. but there was a complication. she lived a half a world away. i took this rather hard, i never told her what i felt for her because i didn't see any point in it: the chances of me ever meeting her were negligible. until she asked my about my country because she said that she's going to move here before this year is out. my heart skipped a beat. i thought this was some kind of divine miracle. i actually thought that this was a chance at finding some degree of happiness  in life. but, sadly, things that seem to be too good to be true usually are just that. good old fb was so kind as to smash into my face the nice notification that she's engaged to some other guy. i was stupid. why else would she cross half the world to come to this rather shitty country that i live in? i was naive. i should've known. and still it broke something inside of me. it's not that i'm that jealous a person, sure it plays a part but that's definately not all of it. it's the combination of the cruel fact that the only person i ever think i'll love is coming all over the world to what is virtually right  around the next corner for me to be with someone else. the irony that i felt when i saw it was downright lethal. i knew not whether i should cry or laugh so i did both. i never believed in 'justice'. i think it's just some made up word that gives some people some consolation now and again when they feel they've been wronged. yet, at that moment, all i could think of was how unfair it all was. what makes it worse that i cannot bring myself to hate the other guy, because she makes him happy and i wouldn't ever do anything to hurt her. but this reaffirmation of my feelings towards on account of the fact that i can't hate him doesn't make it any easier to bear. it all just feels like a checkmate -- no matter where you want to move to, the path is blocked. and this is not some passing fancy. i've thought this true. a lot. she really is what i want in this world. the only thing. i'd happily give my entire life to have her for just one day. hell, a minute would suffice. (none of you have any idea how disgusted i am at myself for writing this pathetic kind of shit). almost every thought i have, is of her. when i close my eyes i see her face, even though i've never seen it irl. i cannot bring myself to do anything anymore. i sleep most of the day by taking (too many) benzodiapine type medications. when i'm awake i drink until i can't exactly call myself conscious anymore and stumble off to bed to sleep for the next 16-18 hours. nothing interests me anymore. i can no longer bring myself to watch a movie, every little gesture of affection just sents daggers through my heart, i don't want to play video games, i don't wan't too listen to music, i don't play the guitar anymore, i barely eat, sometimes i try to read a book but i can't concentrate. writing this is the only sustained effort i've undertaken in the past few days. it felt like a aged 50 years in the space of a month. i really don't feel 20. i feel literally, physically weighed down by everything. beside all this, i have some problems at home after i dropped out of school, both my parents struggle with their mental illnesses, and mine. my mom can't take it if i'm feeling bad because the poor thing will start feeling even worse herself so i really can't talk to her about it. it would devastate her. and my dad's an asshole. end of story. besides, social services in my country have told me i won't be getting a job until i have some psychiatric issues checked out (unrelated to these). college isn't really a possibility anymore as my dad has cut all funding for my education. and on top of all that i have this agony. i actually find myself hoping there is a god so i would have someone to blame it all one. it's easy to start blaming everyone when there's no one to blame. so i've sat down and really thought about it all and come to the conclusion that i don't want it. it's not something i came up with the day before yesterday and am now writing about in the hope somebody may read this and have some wonderful piece of advice to talk me out of it. i've thought about this very carefully and deliberately. i compared every possible scenario and possibility, judging some of it on rational probability and other things on the way i felt. regardless of how it all could be, i don't want any of it. i will not see her coming so close to me only to be with someone else. i won't bear it, i don't want to bear it. moving away from here isn't an option for practical reasons. i've thought a lot about what it would to my family -- my mom would take it hard at first but i think she'd understand it in the end. she loves me as a son but she really doesn't like me as a person. my dad would definately get over it. asshole's told me as much. therefore, i want to have it over and done with before this year's out. before she moves here. i don't want to see my 21st birthday. i feel to old already. as i said before: this is not just another broken heart bawwing tale that will probably pass in a month. i have been feeling like this for quite some time and i don't think all the stars in the sky could fill the whole she left behind. i just want to go to sleep one night, dream of her, and not have to wake up again. that's all i want. i won't live my life torturing myself, waiting for some miracle that isn't coming. i was a fool to believe that anything was ever going to come my way, except for delicious melancholic irony. the irony really is the worst of it all. so that's the long and short of it. i'd like to know is there anybody who can even remotely relate to this kind of vice i'm in? do you think this is a valid reason to consider suicide? to desire something or somebody above all else in this world, something you'd not just kill for but die for to have for just a minute, but still can't have and never will?
and if so, do you have any advice how i could explain this to my mother?",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i'm too much of a cowardii'll be 30 in april. i moved across the country to california with the blessings of my parents. i'm living with my boyfriend in a terrible city, in a small one bedroom apartment. i was okay or a time because i had saved up money so i didn't have to work. the money is running out so i got a job. i wont go into details about the job, but it's working in a warehouse on computers and other devices to configure them. i didn't know the schedule hours would be so long, it's usually 6 days a week, and sometimes 7. days are sometimes 9 to 5, usually 9 to 7 because there are big and important deadlines. i get along with my coworkers okay, but the time lost and my loss of self by the end drives me nuts. i am usually a happy, well-meaning, supportive, loving person who only wants the best for everyone.

now i can't sleep, i can't eat, i can't switch off from work, i can't love my boyfriend like i usually do. i feel like i'm under attack and people keep telling me it'll be okay or i'll get used to it. but it never gets better it's only getting more and more unmanageable. i try to sleep, i try to eat, but my nerves are so shot. i feel like i'm becoming a monster, i can't be the happy healthy me anymore. so why go on?

but i'm too much of a coward. i love my friend and family, i love my boyfriend... but id i cannot even be me anymore i don't see the point. if i can't be happy and make others happy i see no point in life. i don't believe in any religion, i always believed the point was to be good to people. now though, i have no patience for it, i'm not strong enough.

then i get thinking how i have only had this job a week. imagine a lifetime of this? imagine another 30 or 40 years at least? i can't fathom it. i cannot even begin to accept it as something i could overcome. i want to not live but i am too scared to end myself so i'm just trapped to watch myself change into this abomination of stress and self doubt.

there's no way around not working. you just have to do it. my boyfriend says to think of something that would make me feel fulfilled or at least something i could do. i'm drawing a blank though on anything that's not an artistic (and therefore, you have to be really good or end up broke anyway) job.

i'll never retire and i'll never be happy as far as i can see. i go to work from 9 to 7 in about 40 minutes and part of me wants to drive my car off a bridge on the way there. i'm not going to of course but... it's fun to fantasize not having to be tied down to this hell.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i guess i just posted this, i don't know why. maybe it helps someone else or not? it's just that if i can try to consciously identify the times that i'm sabotaging myself and being unfair with myself it can help to change some of these constant negative thought patterns that are haunting me. i edited this post...before it was me complaining complaining complaining, but then i realized why i was feeling in such a bad mood to complain...and it was because i had made myself feel like shit, almost because i was more ""comfortable"" or something feeling that way...it gets disgusting and a self-fulfilling / self-perpetuating spiral of shit that i drag myself down into...but i don't know...maybe thinking about it is a way out of it...just constantly refusing to think those thoughts.

i've been really actively suicidal the past couple of weeks...did a ""test"" run (not giving details for potentially triggering stuff) and have drunk myself into oblivion every day this week. but i guess i have some kind of clarity now, and i don't know if it will last, but i'm going to try again to live. so i dunno if any of you feel like me or not, but maybe we're not screwed after all. maybe there's hope. i don't believe that when i say it, but i'm going to try to keep doing it, because i already know, in the good times, that i can lie to myself and make myself feel like shit; so why can't i just do the same in the opposite direction? living isn't awful when you don't feel so awful, you know? maybe i can just go with it and keep going and try.

i've been forced to move home by family before the shutdowns in australia started. i still had a room on college at uni - they were only encouraging people to move home if they were able. my parents panicked and blew up my phone with texts, my only alternative to coming here was cut them off completely and run out of money. *note - i don't have centrelink or scholarships, they earn just over the limit for me to be in financial hardship. they paid for living expenses at uni while i study full time and burn myself out.*

now i'm stuck in a hoarder's house, i spent the last few days carving out space in my room to sleep and study. i have to eat on the couch, there are no tables that don't have junk all over them. i was reassured that my parents would clean up so i have space to live here, and now they're failing to follow through, as usual.

i'm losing the will to eat, i'm struggling to finish assignments, i can't keep up with online lectures and i have nothing to enjoy or distract myself. i was struggling with feeling suicidal in uni, and slowly recovering after feeling this way for years, and all that effort has disappeared in the blink of an eye. i'm just so tired of this.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i have never self-harmed... i have never tried to kill myself before... nor did i rely on drugs and alcohol.

it professed a depression that is not reliant on environmental factors. i have everything i've ever wanted. i worked and aspired to these goals and dreams and things i felt were necessary to induce happiness. but it doesn't.

depression is depression. it is a chemical imbalance. exercise might help, diet may too. but these are the holistic strategies everyone encourages because they don't understand the depression. the deep, dark, overwhelming and insidiously heavy depression. the kind that when you wake up, look in the mirror, you find a moment of peace and clarity. you smile, because you know that one day you will die.

...

my wife engaged a conversation after reading a comment of mine. she was not judgmental, nor did she feel guilty or insecure about the situation. she does not make me unhappy, she is the best thing to ever happen to me. and i love her.

she did not pry, she did not resolve to my depression as a state of mind. unfortunately it is a way of life. all she did was ask, and listen. i've always been afraid to talk to her when i think of suicide. i know it would hurt her. i never want her to feel at fault, because in no universe would it be anyone's fault.

i say to myself, i want to discuss it with her, i want to communicate and discuss it. but why? i don't want to ruin our camping trip. she is about to go to work in 30min, i don't want to ruin her day. she's home, it's late, i don't want to make her restless. but i wear this on my face and it is all too recognizable.

i explained to her some of the insecurities, the hesitance, and i skirted in a manner of hesitance. i love her.

i felt better after talking. a 10lbs dumbbell was lifted off my chest, but there is still 1990lbs to go. everyday she will make me feel better, another 10lbs lost. i am a very thin guy, but i have so much weight to lose. i slept that night, and i woke the next morning. another day, cross it off the calendar.




i really hope that some of you can talk to someone. anyone. someone will listen, be it a stranger or a loved one. if you die tomorrow, why build a wall today? make yourself vulnerable. what do you have to lose? i really hope in talking to someone, anyone, that you may live another day, if even to only to talk to someone tomorrow. talk with me, together we can survive until tomorrow.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i returned my supplies for suicide today.i've had a pretty hard life, and it's only gotten worse within the last few years. i've always struggled with depression, and contemplated suicide, and even took some pills as a teenager, but never gave it any sort of serious attempt. 

a few months ago my normal dark place got even darker. everything in my life seemed (and still seems) like shit. i'd been thinking about suicide every single day, and i had been researching the methods. i finally decided what i was going to do and i went out and bought some helium tanks, some plastic tubing, and an oven roasting bag. i bought all the things needed to deliver my death. i would be unconscious within 30 seconds and dead in 20 minutes. now i never wanted to feel like this was a decision i made in haste, so i left the supplies in the back of my car. i wanted to know the option was still right there, but i didn't want it close enough to taunt me on a late night where i knew all i had to do was slip a bag over my head and be done with it all. 

there were a lot of times i thought about going out and getting it over with. i thought about renting a nice hotel room so the last things i'd hear would be the crashing of waves on the pacific shore. other times i thought about just driving to a remote parking lot and doing it in the car. i'd be far enough away to be undisturbed, but close enough to be discovered in a somewhat timely matter. 

today, in a disturbingly calm manner, i finally decided to bring the supplies in and get everything assembled, so that when the time came i wouldn't have to fuss with much. so, i went out to my car, and started carrying in the items. on my dining room table sat my diy suicide kit. pictures of balloons and words about children's birthday parties adorned the side of the boxes. most people who bought these were looking forward to celebrating another year of life, and i bought them with the intent to do just the opposite. 

for some reason, as i pulled the tubing from the home depot bag, i couldn't help but think this was just not right. something about being so calm and collected while doing this just made me pause. i looked at my receipt. it was beyond the 30 days allowed for in the policy, but i wondered if i could get my money back. it was this one thought that made me decide that what i was planning to do wasn't right for me, at least for now. the fact that i thought about getting my money back. something like that doesn't matter in death, so why was i concerned about it?

right then, i said to myself, ""i need to find it in myself to give this one more shot."" i called the store i purchased my helium from and told them i had a couple of sealed boxes which i ended up not needing, and asked if they would make an exception and allow me to return them beyond their date. they said, ""no problem."" i was allowed to change my mind. now i can't say how long this will last. something terrible may happen to me tonight and tomorrow i may be buying those tanks again, but i know that i at least have given myself another day.

so he told me that she said to her best friend that she was going to make a move on my best friend once we were broken up. thankfully tho, he won’t let her do that because he knows what that would do to me. 

the other news that made me happy, a few months ago she went to a party, she didn’t tell me who’s party (but i don’t really mind) 
and that she actually cheated on me while at said party. 

now that i know that i’m so happy i got out of that relationship and not speaking to her anymore. sorry for this being a bit long but just needed to get it off my chest.

those days, i spend so much time fighting myself, trying to silence this part of me that wants to make it all stop. it’s becoming harder and harder to argue against. it’s been this way for over ten years. i am an adult now. i have fully supported myself for years. things are actually pretty ok. so why must i fight myself to stay alive?

i am so tired. my lists of reasons to live have been replaced by reasons to not do it today. minor inconveniences for those in my life, my roommate having to find a subletter for the rest of our lease or my coworkers having to cover for me until they can replace me. that list is quickly followed by all the ways i could prepare them for my departure: emptying my bank account to cover rent for a few months, doing it when i have a few days off in a row and they’d have some time to figure out the schedule. this list scares me the most. it makes me realize just how ready and willing i am. the right time will present itself soon enough, and i’m afraid i won’t be strong enough to fight back.

i know my friends and family would understand. they would grieve me, they would miss me, but they would understand. they know the pain i have endured since i was a young child. they have watched me suffer. they will not say it, but they know i have not gotten any better.

i ended up getting sent to the police station after going out into the streets and apparently assaulting a mother and child and also damaging some property . thank god all i did was slap the child. the mother beat the living day lights out of me and i cant barely remember a thing. i just remember getting sent to the police station, getting strip searched because i told them i was going to kill myself and finally waking up with no idea where i was, how i got there or why i was here. i was still tripping on the lsd too.
ended up having to admit to everything and getting a solicitor help me out in the interview. tomorrow is the court date and i feel like crying. honestly i don't know what to do, i am living over at a friends without the landlords approval (basically i am still living in halls and if security finds out i am here they will call the police and i will be in even more trouble) though really i have no where else to go, not enough money for a hotel and not the guts to tell my parents. i have not told my parents because they will disown me and i am tempted to just slit my wrists and be done with it. also might i add the country i am studying in is not my home country so i need to get my plane flight home eventually and i don't even know what the court will decide for me tomorrow. i don't know how i might explain to my parents finally that i might not be able to go home for the summer since i might need to serve prison time.

anyway a little while ago me and my foster dad had to do a favour for the head of the place. got to know him. super chill guy. he seemed to be a bit iffy on the place being so religious and said that more aspects of life should be studied. which i agree with. 

now something that i've been keeping a secret from pretty much everyone in my life up until this point is that i actually have a girlfriend. the reason i kept it secret is because i'd get into deep shit if they found about it. and even deeper if i found out i got her pregnant.

so recently i was talking to the head in private. i think he knows what's going on with me. he mentions that i could do some things to help her out but it would go against the school and my foster family. 

which brings me up to now. my foster dad found out about it and what i've been doing. we had a huge fight. we ended up surrounded by lava on platforms getting pushed around on top of it and at some point he got the high ground. i said fuck it i can beat him. i jumped up and he fucking sliced of 2 of my legs and my arm with his fucking lightsaber. i hate that bitch now. 

luckily the head finds me lying there almost dead and gets me to his place. gives me a new arm and legs and gives me some dope ass armour. i'm listening to this guy now, fuck obi-wan. i had to ask him though ""where is padme? is she safe? is she alright?""",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"no motivation to livethis is very unlike me to write something like this, but i really don't know what else to do. 

i started having suicidal thoughts back in 8th grade, when something happened that triggered my now anxiety issue. before than i was pretty social in my friend groups, but the anxiety caused me to shrink back into my own world. 8-12th grade for me felt more like a dream than reality. i really didn't care about anything that was going on, even though it probably didn't seem like that to anyone around me. this lack or caring caused me to not really develop any discernible skills or interests in life. this resulted in the shrinking of my friend groups, and the relationships with my still friends feeling empty. my grades were abysmal, and my parents were definitely not thrilled. i was pretty much on autopilot for all of high school. 

i kept telling myself that i could possibly fix all these problems when i got to college. i thought that i would get to college and be an upbeat student, join a bunch of clubs, and get my grades on track. i also started to plan for the future (i was thinking about law school), and realized that i had a huge interest in disney (possibly working there in some capacity). i know my interest in disney is really strange for a male in his early 20s, but it's whatever. 

my first semester in college went really well, actually. i was able to make deans list, which i know isn't too difficult, but it was something. however, i still didn't really make any real friends. i commute, and it's really not easy to get to know people. i also don't drink or do drugs, which was the common pastime of many of the people i did meet. this same trend continued into my second semester of school. in my second semester, i had a speech class with a professor that really got on my nerves. at some point in the semester i felt that anxiety from high school come back, which i think was because of that speech class. it was much worse this time though. i had to start talking to a counselor at school, but i just lied about everything to her so i could get it over with. the reason i mentioned disney earlier was because during these semesters i had been applying to their college program. i thought that getting into it would be the one positive thing i needed to happen in life to turn this all around. i got rejected every time. 

my anxiety continued to get worse with the lack of people i had around me. the more time i had to myself, the worse it got. i came back for fall semester, and thought i'd give it one last shot to try and meet people. i joined this academic fraternity on campus, which really isn't my style, but i thought i'd give it a shot. to my surprise, i actually met a group of kids that i really liked in this fraternity. a group of us started to hang out and watch movies a couple times a week. i was actually getting super excited because i felt like i was finding a place where i could be comfortable. i started talking to one of the girls that was a part of that group, and developed feelings for her. i knew i was dealing with the issues i talked about above, but i was kind of pressured into talking to her about these feelings by people that were a part of the movie watching group. we talked about it, and started going out. this was a huge deal for me because i never dated anyone, and thought that this might be the thing to turn my life around. 

it seemed like everything was going well with this girl at the beginning. our dates would be extremely long, and pretty fun. our mutual ""friend"" group was pretty excited about it too. i was terribly awkward around her all the time though. i often said stupid stuff, and struggled with general communication skills. the one very negative aspect to this relationship was that it caused my grades to drop a good amount, which were the thing i was the most proud of before. it didn't matter though to me at that time, because things seemed to be going well with this girl. winter break rolled around and we had been going out for a couple weeks and were about to not see each other much for a month. we agreed to meet up a couple times over break. however, every time we were suppose to hang out she had an excuse to get out of it. she pretty much ghosted me for the break. with a week left in the winter break, she said she was in a weird place and i deserved better (which i know she didn't mean). it took me a little over a month to ruin this. i've already had a relatively low self esteem, but this just made it worse. i had gotten her a christmas present, and i tried to give it to her when we got back to school to maintain our movie watching group, but she has no interest in talking to me. ruining this relationship hurt, but the fact that i ruined the first friend group i made at school, and for a while, hurts most of all. my grades are continuing to drop, and i just got rejected from the disney program again. it just seems like i have nothing left.

i don't really have anyone to actually talk to anymore. i have always had suicide as an option in the back of my head. i always felt like that would be the way my life ended anyways. the other day i wrote the note. the only thing stopping me is that i know it would crush my family. it's also not for any one of the reasons above specifically, i think its just a culmination of all these failures in my life. i ruin most of things that seem like they are going well in my life. also, i feel like i just don't know who i am anymore, and i've wasted so much of my life already. it would be easier to end it, than to continue this. my motivation to live is gone. 

also, i know this all seems really stupid to someone who is actually having serious life issues, but it's hard for me to really explain what i'm feeling. i just needed to write it all out. sorry for the long post.",suicide,suicide,1.0

before i was 15 my life was great. me and all my friends were super close and it was great. then i made the stupidest decision of my life i changed schools. i became really anti social not having a familiar face in my school, i even skipped some of my classes which i have never done.

the intern speaker who i looked up to so much was getting married which was amazing news, then he said he got a full time job as a youth speaker... 6 hours away. 

thats when i realized all my friends and everyone i knew was moving forward in their lives and im still me from 2 years before. not even changed, i got in a fistfight with my bestfriend of 12 years cause i need to grow up.

i also saw that all my friends had a girl in there lives and i still had no one.

lets fastforward to now, ive had the best weekend me and my friends went up to the old intern speakers house and we all agree it was the bes tweekend of our lives. then i got home and now everything has hit me at once, everyone is moving forward with their lives and im still 14. everything in m life has changed but me, my dog has died and i still go about my day as if she were still here.

i cant even get my point across to you through words im just confused.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0
"can someone please remind me of reasons life is worth living?i sincerely don't understand why i need to keep going.

my anxiety and depression are so overwhelming that it's almost impossible to leave the house. i keep wishing something awful would happen to me so i don't have to feel this way anymore.

no one cares about me, or what would happen to me. i don't know. . .i just need reasons why life is worth it.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i dont want to die but i dont want to livei've rewritten this about 4 times now and i just don't know how to put it into words. the word ""depression"" has seemingly lost its value over the past couple years because it seems like everyone has it now. and whether that's true or not, it's not taken as seriously as it should. i've been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 3 years and i've personally decided i cannot deal with this shit for one more fucking second. not only does my depression put me in a constant loop of suicidal thoughts and despair, but it also pisses me off. i've had anger issues since i was a little kid and i've been taking meds for them for years and years and years now and those don't seem to helping, so i've been giving this whole thing some thought for quite some time now and i came to the conclusion that i don't understand who i am or what i'm doing here, and for that i don't enjoy life. to be more specific, nothing brings me joy anymore. i don't like video games, i don't like food, i don't like people, i don't like sleeping, i don't like being awake, i don't like my home, i don't like traveling, i don't like anything. i don't even like my own family. 
a while back i figured out the meaning of life. (my meaning at least) to enjoy life. and i've realized that i just can't do that because i just don't like shit. i thought maybe one day this would end but it just seems to be getting worse. and i know everyone says that and also everyone says things get better, which i believe, but i don't care. i can't live like this any longer. i can't even cry. i've become so numb to the pain where i feel like i'm a fucking robot and all the emotions i feel are just in my head. not to mention my thinking process. anytime anything ever happens, i think to myself; is this worth being here for? and the answer is almost always no. in the midst of all of this i believe i was given a sign, i lost my job, my only friend and my girlfriend in one week. i have no motivation to do anything anymore. i don't like being alive but i just can't seem to kill myself. i wake up believing i exist for the sole purpose of being tortured every living second. this is my personal hell.

please, someone save me. leave a tip, a suggestion, anything. i'm about to give up. i can't take being alive much longer.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i failed after all these years of getting good scores, i finally failed maths. i fucking failed the subject. my dad and mom got really mad and annoyed. i can't believe it. i can't believe i actually failed a subject. i hate it. they, they made me delete my discord account. i didn't delete it. i couldn't. i've made too many good friends online than i have ever made irl. i delete my alt instead because i just couldn't delete my main.

"i got arrested and charged. i am a bad person. i want to die. i want to kill myself.i got arrested for the first time in my life for assaulting my (now ex) partner. i am 23f with three young children, the youngest of which is his. i wouldn’t get out of bed to start the day because i had an alarm set and wanted to close my eyes and stay in bed for 15 more minutes, so he took the blankets off me. when i tried to take the blanket off of him, he threw me to the ground. i told him to get out of my house (we don’t live together, he provides no financial assistance to my family or bills or home, and only provides occasional assistance to our child for toys and formula). he stayed laying in bed, saying no, laughed at me.
i tried to physically pull him out of my bed so that he would get up and leave. he then took my phone and threatened to call my parents. i don’t know why he took my phone when he had his phone and both my parents direct contacts on his phone. i was left unable to call for help. feeling threatened and vulnerable and scared, i then attacked him in an effort to get my phone back. 
he did end up leaving after i reluctantly took my children and myself to my neighbours to call for help.
the police came, took my side of the story, left to take his side of the story and then they came back and arrested me. luckily my wonderful friend had just come over and was able to take care of my children while i went into police custody.

i am not looking for sympathy. i kicked, grabbed, punched at him and more, and that was wrong.
but i feel defeated. i feel like this encourages his behaviour and he is allowed and able to make someone feel vulnerable and scared inside their own home. this is not the first time i have asked him to leave my home because he was being intimidating. this is not the first time he has taken my phone in an attempt to get what he wants.

now i have an arrest, a dv charge, which will hang over my head forever. not only that, but my ex partner said he feared for the kids safety even when i changed them, changed his sons dirty nappy, and even changed myself all in front of him so we could get out after he leaves. 

before this happened, i had control over my life. i had major and minor plans that i was working towards. i had some sort of self doubt but was seeing a psych. i was going to break up with him anyway because he treats my young daughter from another father like shit, i don’t love him, i believe he doesn’t love me and only wants sex and to see our child. 

and now it’s all down the drain. i have a charge on my name, a police record. this is the end of my life. i don’t know how anything can get better. 
i was about to enrol my kids into more childcare so i could go to work and start saving for a house. but who will hire me now? i am a violent person.
i wanted to date and fall in love with someone who would treat my kids as equal, and accept me and all my mistakes. but dv crosses the line, who would love someone so fucked up?

i used to think i was a good mother. and i suppose i am most of the time. i read to them every night, i commit to their needs all day, all night with very minimal help from their fathers, i prepare for them fresh meals focusing on a balanced diet. countless people and health and social workers have told me they are happy, thriving, social children. but what shit does that mean now? my ex partner told the police i was neglectful and would take anger out on my kids. sure, i smack them when they’re extremely naughty but i have supportive friends at my disposal when i need help with the kids. 
and that’s all to shit now. i have failed my children. it doesn’t matter what anyone thinks about my parenting, to police and on police document i am a horrible, neglectful parent. 
their fathers are so good, they’d be much better off with them than in the care of someone violent.

i don’t know how to kill myself. i frequent the watchpeopledie subreddit and feel so sorry for the suicides, but now i sympathise with how they’re feeling. there’s no escape from my past and horrible future. but i can contribute to a better future for everyone if i was dead. i trust that the children’s fathers would choose kind and loving step mothers. everyone will mourn me but then i will be forgotten. their lives will go on, it will be hard but they are beautiful strong people that don’t need the burden of my life if i continue to live. i wish i lived in america so i could buy a gun and shoot myself in the brain. but i don’t, so i can only entertain less favourable options. i don’t want to tell anyone. my life will not get better. i want to die. i want to leave. i have no future anymore. but my children do, i hope they’ll strive for happiness and fulfilment in everything that they do. i trust that they are in good guidance. i hope they will be okay.",suicide,suicide,1.0
i knew it was a bad idea to try to talk to my mom about my darkess.nessknessthe last few days have been hell for me. i figured to try to reach out to my mom just as a cry for help.i have been debating if i should talk or not. kept hinting i wanted to talk. my mind was in a very dark place. we eventually get onto facebook after texting (too deep to talk on person). i had briefly just mentioned i was in a mental dark place. thats all i said. i didnt say anything about suicide. supposedly that was too much. she goes on and just doesnt say anything. now i feel like that was not a good idea. now i remember why i keep all my feelings to myself. it sucks. i cant talk to my wife either.,non-suicide,suicide,0.0

"i just need someone to talk to... a chance to breatheeach day the thoughts, the plans get more vivid, as it comes closer to the holiday season, as my calender marks another, day,  another year where my physical health continues to fail me, taking my mental health with it. 

i have a clearer plan every day, but equally i see little parts of me trying to fight it. find any distraction. 

the problem is i've pushed almost everyone away. i've watched their lives get better infinitely since being free of me, genuinely... but i do like talking to people. 

i just need a focus, and anyone left who can talk to me (immediate family mostly) wants to talk about my health, emotional or physical and will not listen to my pleas to do otherwise. or worse they want to promise (without any grounds) that i'll get better... 

it's an empty promise, not backed up by any medical findings... and i get that you say that to loved ones because you just do, because even if their quality of life is shit, and they're miserable, family are accustomed to your being around, and society tells us we can't encourage suicid so we lie to people, often times offering empty promises, because most people don't know what else to do..

in amongst them and my realities i'm trying to busy my mind until i can amore y least sort out my will and get a more cetain plan in place. i also don't want to be the selfish prick who takes the holidays from people by killing myself during that time. 

so my mind just needs a rest from the thoughts, prescription drugs and alcohol (even though i hate drinking i've tried to use it to numb me..), and counselling lines seem genuinely geared towards making things worse, even if you beg them to speak of something else for the exact purpose of getting a break from suicidal thoughts..

i don't know where to find physical/mental health free chat opportunities. i used to be creative, known as a good gift give with clever ideas, i
i try and interact with those on r/giftideas but the back and forth is seldom. i check r/tattoos constantly hoping someone will want help brainstorming ideas for their next piece as i used to love tattoos, but more so just helping people generally. 

yet, i'm trying to stay away from subs where people need emotionally intensive assistance because i know i can become too involved..as before i got sick i largely existed for others who were very ill emotionally and physically and needed my care... but i also avoid it because i'm not who i used to be, i'm bled dry and i don't trust myself to be good enough to give good advice on *really* imporant things. 

i just miss the back and forth of anything but this and the subs feel...""at home""/that do offer that distraction don't need me. 

i'm sorry for wasting peoples time. like most things depression related there probably is no answers, and consequently what this comes down to is just an incoherent rant from someone going to bed each night pleading for death.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i feel like i've been kicked out of heaven twice.(as pretext, i fought hard for months to get this person back into my life, i could feel with every fiber of my being that she still cared about me, the world told me i was wrong and to give up. i listened to my gut and kept fighting, it was absolute hell everyday, often times i almost completely lost hope. then one day she popped back into my life, she had forgiven me. i was back in heavenly bliss, i worked hard to make sure the relationship was great, every time i saw her)

one day the girl of my dreams, who i have been dating for awhile, and have been through a lot together, just stopped talking to me. i gave her some space, then reached out over steam, we played some games together and had a good time, lots of laughs and fun. now back to no contact, i give her some space, then head over to her place after a week. she says she is dealing with traumatic stuff due to a court case about her being sexually assaulted. i told her i understand and would give her space, i just asked that she check in with me once or twice a week, she agreed. i sent her a little care package filled with stuff she liked, and a letter basically saying i support her, and to take her time getting better. another week goes by, and she doesnt respond to the two texts i sent over the course of the week. i stop by again, i ask if there is some other reason she isnt speaking to me (lost interest, someone else, etc), and if there is she can and should tell me. she shakes her head no, that she just feels awful inside. we hang out that night, watch a good tv show and have some good laughs. i leave feeling hopeful. another week of silence. i go to her place and she is clutching her guitar like a child with a security blanket. i ask her whats been wrong with her lately. she told me she wasn't sure if she could handle a relationship right now. i told her that was fine, and that i would wait weeks, months, or even a year if thats what it took for her to get better, i love this woman with every fiber of my being, and i will do anything for her. i wait a month, spend the time working on myself, i get into and make fast progress in rock climbing, i start guitar lessons back up, redesign my apartment, and get some new clothes to start dressing nicer. i go on some dates, just to keep myself from getting rusty, nothing serious or risque. i reach out to her, asking if she still wanted to collaborate on this song i've been working on for awhile that she showed interest in. nothing, try again in a week, nothing. i ask her family about the court date, and they say they arent sure but will keep me in the loop! i take that as a good sign. i send her flowers and a letter saying that i want to be there for her when she eventually does need to speak up. i talk to her parents to make sure she got the flowers. ""she did! they're gorgeous"" the family member said. i took it as another good sign. i hear nothing from my beloved.  i text her family member asking if i can stop by to check on her. ""she isnt here"", so i ask if i can stop by while she is. ""youll have to ask her, shes been crazy busy with midterms lately"" here i am, texting her today to see if she wants to catch up, since we've both been going through a lot and growing. i am hiding from my phone again out of the fear i think will likely be realized. there will be no response. no matter how many times i was told that it was a matter of her dealing with her own personal issues, i realize more and more its actually her way of breaking up with me without actually doing so. of leaving me without saying a word. the worst part is, i still care for her greatly. i seriously doubt i can find anyone that makes me as happy as she did, we clicked in every way you can in a relationship.

why should i continue to live? i don't think i can ever find someone that will make me happier. i don't want to settle, that would not be fair to anyone involved. what is there to look forward to? ""oh a gentle breeze, the sunset"" thats nice and all, but i felt like i was in heaven with her, it was bliss. yes, i still had problems, but i knew i could face anything with her by my side. now i have to live life, hoping, by some miracle i find someone i like more, which is something i dont really believe to be possible. i fought so hard, i tried to make my living space better, i work out, i picked up a new hobby i really enjoy, i hang out with friends, i'm improving and creating with guitar, my grades and career have never been better. yet i'm still fucking miserable, i wake up at least four times a night. i don't know what to do, i feel damned to live a mediocre life on earth after having been to heaven, it feels wrong. where is happiness when you've been kicked out of heaven twice?",suicide,suicide,1.0

what is the difference between reaching out and attention seeking. i guess i ask that, because i feel like, when i talk, i'm merely doing the latter. maybe it's just the loneliness speaking, but every time i reach out, it pushes someone away. maybe i'm just reaching out too much, i can't expect others to care, so my desperation just to be talking to someone shows.

i don't even know why i'm posting, i feel ready to die, so i guess this is the right place to discuss that. i'm out of ways to express it, and people to express it to, liars who told me they wanted to be there for me, and then decided they weren't interested any more. it makes it... almost impossible for me to trust again, but i know if i don't try, then it's just over. before anyone mentions it, i've tried councelling, therapy, the works, and it's useless, to the point i know i get upset at the suggestion.

"life is terrible 

*rambling  nonsense, talk about my goddamn life, beware. i'll probably delete this  post. will decide later. excuse my grammar and some language butchering. originally posted onn* r/self

at  least that's what i see everywhere around me. starting with my own  family. my mother is unhappy with her life she has put her life at risk  at least twice, she cries to the point of getting to a state of shock  and the rest of the time she pretends she doesn't care and goes out to  forget and enjoy despite everything and everyone. she's had it rough  growing up with her father dying from a brain injury for working as a  boxer to barely bring food to the table, she was responsible for her 6  brothers and sister, she was going to marry someone she loved but left  her  in the  altar, she later married for real years later only because  of ""female"" peer pressure with a man that that she only knew as a  coworker, they didn't date, just straight up marry. later in she had me  and my brother just barely since she was getting old by that time.  worked her ass out to get us to a good school but she had to abandon us  and sometimes she would get mad and hit us for not getting good degrees.  she doesn't remember anything about it.

my  father. just yesterday he was puking in the bathroom for so much  alcohol. he's a good man but he's fucked up. doesn't talk much about his  past but i know he lived in even more poverty that my mother. one day  he said he and his family had a patch of terrain were they lived in a  makeshift room made of metal sheets and wood planks, their bathroom was a  hole in the ground and he sometimes had to look for food in the trash.  he never knew his father. he saw once a man get his throat sliced and  killed in front of him. he has incredible luck in general, which i don't  really know what to think about. he likes cartoons and old black and  white movies with a famous comedian here in my country, is not  interested in watching much else, which would be good but it has  affected how he interacts with the world (?). this one is hard to  explain but if you have ever seen back to the future, the first scene  where marty is having dinner with his family; or in the simpsons where  bart writes something in the back of  homer's head and he wants to see  what it says and cannot see, starts spinning around, everyone laughing,  until they realize is not funny anymore and instead is just sad. well  that. the feeling of everyone knowing what he cannot see, the  uselessness of doing anything because nothing can be done or said, the  embarrassment. because it doesn't just stays as something that he likes,  he acts it out in real life like his life is a comedy... anyway, he is  overweight, alcoholic and always has had suicidal ideation because he  never has enough money, mostly, even if we now live good enough thanks  to their efforts but when he was working and earning good money he never  saved a cent and now what the pension gives him is just enough. he  doesn't have family and the ones that last are terrible people that has  gone to jail and normally just come to him for money. he would invite  them sometimes and show off what he has to them. nothing to be worried  about. he has never physically touched me, as in grab hands to even pass  coins to buy something, or hug.

my  brother. at some point he just stopped talking to me. i don't know why  but i feel like he considers me an annoyance even if i barely talk to  him. and maybe he's right. just like me he just wants to get out of the  house as soon as possible but cannot make enough money to sustain  himself, same like me. he's a big fellow. he was bullied in school for  that of course. at some point he became a bully himself, which made him  an aggressive person in general. he's always been someone very distant.  once or twice i've physically hurt him in fits of anger. he's sexist  too. we had to saved him from a kidnapping with gun in hands. he has  destroyed 2 or our cars, never played a cent for it. to what he thinks i  don't know. i don't know him that well even when i see him daily and  lives with us.

my uncles and aunts all  are in terrible condition. one has had cancer treatment but she cannot  move or eat normally because of the same treatment, they ""burned"" and  destroyed her to try to cure her, no shady methods or anything, it's  just how the treatment goes. another appears to have a good successful  life but his daughter hates him, she studied hard to be psychologist and  is working as a kinder teacher barely making it. her daughter's  daughter ran away from her home because they fought too much and is  working as a nurse, his son was schizophrenic and  died hit by a truck,  his spouse died a month  later of sadness. the aunt i wrote about, her  daughter has a child with autism that, and it's going to sound terrible  but it's true, came to ruin their already broken family. her husband is  struggling with stress, it caused half of his face to get paralyzed  and doctors told him ""don't get stressed of your face will fell off"", or  something to that effect. another one is a complete sociopath. the  story goes that he burned the cat of one of my other aunts alive and  laughed as it was running in pain. why he did it? because he was jealous  of it. once it died he cooked it and gave it to my aunt to eat it not  knowing it was her own cat. my friend. he is unhappy with his marriage.  married only because of social pressure. his friend, she had a tumor on  her brain and is now paralyzed. i could tell you about my coworkers or  just anyone and they are not good. even my own cat, i rescued it from  the garbage where someone had thrown her away in a bag.

me.  well... as far as things that had happened to me i'm ""lucky"" to be  alive, at least 4 times lucky. as i posted in other occasions i still  find really funny and terrible/scary that i know what human flesh taste  like because of a real life sweeney todd like person from whom i used to  bought food not knowing why they tasted so good... at least. for a time  i saw my grandfather, adoptive father of my father, go from being  healthy to have help his second wife to carry his pretty much skeletal  body to bath him in a small tube. he was easy to carry since he was so  light. they tried to do everything to cure him, he wanted to live. my  grandmother died a slow violent death too. in her bed but it looked to  me like one of her organs finally exploded and she vomited blood until  she passed out cold. my father wasn't present, he didn't wanted to see.  i'm a bag of mental issues. thanks to my parents i don't lack anything  material, but i'm a piece of shit because i'm fucking old and i can't  get a decent job even with my studies because i can't talk to people.  i'm pathetic. i don't share my feelings or thoughts to anyone. i'm  quite. i like to listen. and people talk to me.

all  people around me are sad or crazy, they are barely living, have  terrible things happen to them with lasting effects. even if many of us  are living, working, some in the city, some in other places, some with  money and all commodities, some joining some kind of mafia; we are all  not ok in the slightest. some will try to be like ""well there's a lot to  be happy about"", ""i'm grateful for what i still have"", "" things will  get better""... i'm not sure about that. i respect their view point  but... reality is kind of shitty. and, well, they don't really believe  themselves because it hurts them and prefer to not think about it  telling themselves otherwise. it's so hard. it's so much bullshit. and  it's normal. it's so... ok. it's just how it is. the world is beautiful  but living it is a coin toss.

no matter  what you do, no matter what you try, no matter who you are; something is  there to get you and make everything fall apart.

there's  nothing you can trust. not even morally. if it's not you it's the  neighbor or... nature that wants to kill you. there's nothing else you  can do but to just be yourself, whatever that implies. because you will  end up being just another story. good or bad, terrible or endearing; it  doesn't matter.

why are we even here but to delude ourselves into thinking there's some meaning to our suffering. *why are we here... just to suffer* (haha! aaahhhh... what an idiot). we just keep going and we don't know why.

i  don't know if i should just let myself go, you know? abandon everything  and just enjoy what i have right now without any kind of worry. ran out  of money, be happy and then die early by my own hand. it's just another  story among others after all, is not even going to be half of what  anyone is going to remember. so bad that not everyone agrees and i  wouldn't like to hurt anyone... i could very well do the same as  everyone. get drunk, go party, tell everyone to fuck off even if they  don't deserve it, do whatever i need to be functional, do an oopsie  every now and then and shrugged it off. but i care too much.

"questioning morality i guess that title's pretty vague. what i mean is that i worry sometimes about if i'm actually a decent human being. i don't know if i do what i do based on my own moral perceptions, or just because i listen to my parents' (who are good people) guidance. am i actually doing what ***i*** think is right, or deep down am i vile and my parents' are the ones keeping me afloat and doing what's right?

the only way i can know is when i am out of my parents' influence. it can be grueling.

i've had this talk with my mom, and she says that because i even have these thought proves were my morality is. others have told me the same thing in response to general moral questing, outside of the child-to-parent dynamic. this has helped me, but sometimes i still worry.

"the person i'd thought i'd be isn't going to happeni have spent my entire life building up around this image of what i wanted to be. i'd join the army, i'd become the first woman to pass special ops training. if that didn't happen then at least i'd be serving my country like i always wanted. when i started getting pain while exercising i changed my plans. police force would be my goal. after several years i'd work toward becoming a detective and help the local community. pain got worse.

"new to this what am i supposed to post? why i feel suicidal? if i'm supposed to make a throwaway, i'm not going to.

i've never had a friend in real life, and very little online. i've never been invited to a birthday party. i've never been invited to a sleepover, or to go paint-balling. i have stayed inside the house for most of my life.

things seem to fall apart faster than i can build. this year i transferred to a new school thinking i would make friends. it seemed that way until i was once again labelled the nerd/loser and ignored about a week into the school year. i am alone again.

it's always been that way except for my best friend. i met her online and we dated for 18 months and were in love until this summer. we decided long distance hurt too much and we would try again when we can visit one another. 

not the wisest decision ever. we both feel farther into depression and have stopped talking as much. she started cutting again, i've started to strangle myself with cords and sometimes cutting. we don't rely on one another or support one another as much. in her desperation she also got a boyfriend. he is stupid, ugly, and is clingy and desperate. he also stalks me. he doesn't support her at all, as i've read in his online profiles, he's not very good at getting a girlfriend so he wants to keep her for the sake of having her. she doesn't really like him, he 
 even get any of her jokes. when she doesn't talk to me she reveals her affections for me and how important i am to her. it's hard to explain this part. basically we both show eachother subtle signs that we still love one another. please, i understand this situation more than anyone else so i'd appreciate it if no one told me to stop talking to my best friend or something similar. 

i am alone. i barely eat. for 2 years now i've gotten these awful headaches where i can barely see, my head pounds, i feel like i'm going to throw up, and i get paranoid and delusional. i don't really feel like eating because i'm hoping i'll drop dead without me having to slit my veins or something. 

lately i feel like i can't breathe, like my chest is pressing against my lungs. my bestfriend has been busy with finals and her grandmother died so she hasn't spoken to me. she says she's also going through something and she'll tell me later. it makes me sad, because she would have told me before. 

on february 28th, what would have been our second anniversary, i will tell her i love her. i might also kill myself on that day, and never have to deal with this again. i try and try and try and try to make friends at school, and i do everything my parents do. i fake the smiles, i try to involve myself in their conversation, but the second i say something about team fortress 2 or something like skyrim or a book i like, i am a geek and must be shunned. and my parents? my father hits me because he's not my biological father. my mother judges me on everything, almost as much as my father. she almost hit me with a hot frying pan because i told her to quiet down last week. they both judge me, they say i'm the next mall shooter. that i'm a sociopath and if i don't get friends quickly they're going to get real mad. 
don't they realize i've been trying since kindergarten? and it still hasn't worked?

at what point does a person who's brave enough to reach out for help when they're suicidal become toxic to the person they're reaching out to?

when i try to get you to call a hotline number, someone who's trained to help you, and you say you only want to talk to me?

when you leave me a suicide voicemail saying goodbye but it feels like you're waiting for me to respond because you just want someone to show empathy towards you?

when does it become selfish for me to say, ""i can't be the only person to carry the burden of your weight by myself when you're like this? you have to take responsibility for your own life and not pin it on the people around you"" even though you feel like you're at 'the end of your rope' and you need help from someone you love.

why is it that every time i move forward and i feel fine again you come along and drain my emotions and my progress back to zero and you make me feel like if i don't talk to you enough, or see you enough, or make you feel validated as a person you're going to kill yourself?

how am i supposed to feel when you don't actually want to die and you feel like you have no other options left, but you won't listen when i try to give you help or options that aren't me?

i feel angry, and sad, and empty.

but i also don't know how i'm supposed to feel.. 

when your family needs help, you help them. but where can i draw a line for my own emotional safety and tell you how i feel without you taking it wrong?

i don't know what to do.

tldr; i've been all over the internet trying to find something relevant to my situation. my dad is toxic to my mental health when he's suicidal but refuses to seek help outside of me. i become vulnerable to suicidal thoughts/have come a long way from my past depression, but his behavior, words, actions, etc often revert my progress. it's been 4 years since i last talked him out of suicide and he was hospitalized after. where do i draw the line for myself? i don't want my dad to die, but he's putting a lot of pressure on me to help him and doesn't understand when i try to tell him how i feel. it's just about how sad he is. :(

"rip to everyone that lost their life on new years day.many people i’ve come across—wether it be online or in real life have decided to end their life around the holiday season (mostly new years) because of their pain. i just want everyone to know that you are not alone and many people can relate to you and don’t want to see you pass on. don’t let the holidays determine if you get to see another day. so many redittors have kill themselves today, and they’re not responding to anything i type.

this mere fact makes me cry, and i don’t want anyone to die, wether i know them in real life or not.

i made this post because i want you all to know that you do not have to end your own life. things will get better and you will not ever find happiness. you may not have a picture perfect life, living in your dream house sipping a martini on your front porch with a so, but things will improve for you if you keep trying. 

happy new year, everyone.

just thinking about how i'd tell others i won't go to that city made me think about what if i just still go there, but not to her place and instead just look around, stay up through the night, renting a hotel room for a night, writing letters to those 2 or 3 loved ones, sending them out and then do it.

all of that at work and it was a thought progress of like 10min

"please. help, i've been submitting this for the last week, no responses...just religious and spammers.hey all,

it's really hard to find an individual, or even a medical professional who is more than just a recent grad who dials 911 at anyone expressing anything slightly less than farting rainbows and kittens.  


i've gone though 3 psychiatrists and undergone a large number of invasive tests...and the results are in. i'm not chemically depressed...i'm officially logically depressed. i've also been with 5 different therapists over the last 5 years who all...sadly tossed up their hands not knowing where to go. (the last one suggested i take out personal ads in the paper to try and make friends :/ )


that is, i've got an odd i.q. and means of reasoning. (it has served me wonders in the engineering world and music!) problem is, ever since middle school 'distraction' has been the goal of avoiding depression. 


and after quitting college, going to a trade school, becoming a professor of the class i took, then going onto working the floor in a global steel renewable energy company, to becoming their senior welding engineer of that same company all in less than 2 years, only to quit when i was being asked to partake in fraudulent activities...i'm back in middle school. 


distraction is the game.


i'm curious if there are any therapists or psychologists who can rationally work through things instead of the usual 'i'm here to help you solve the issue.'....i'm looking for those few pragmatic individuals who don't find answers in just locking someone up. (i promise, i volunteered to be in 'da looney bin' for several months, and all that was really said was, 'his participation in group discussion made the doctors uncomfortable because his reasonings, while popularly taboo, weren't unreasonable. i.e. the question of 'is suicide ever an option?' 'always...if you're being ran over by a steamroller...toes first, relief if sooner sought that proving hope for unaltered resolution exists.') that and they couldn't understand how a competent pianist would volunteer to participate.


anyways, kinda stuck in a rut. no, i'm not foolish enough to take my own life. sheesh, i know there's still 'hope' as i'm still trying. issue is, i keep adding in different scenarios...and the results are still...bubkis. (and it's not as simple as 'well we all die anyways so what's the point') i promise it's much more well constructed than that.


so, if you or anyone else know of someone or somewhere that has a proactive and non-knee jerk reaction to people wanting to discuss depression without limitation (including the planning of self termination), please let me know.


suicide hotlines are meant for those that are scared and terrified and need help. that's stellar for them, and i always wish them well. same with all the 'dial up' and 'here to comfort' phone services.

- social coaches

thank you for your help!

edit: yes, physical exercise is a great idea! i've only owned a motor vehicle for 3 years now, and prior i walked, biked, and hiked everywhere. even did a marathon a year ago! but i've been sitting stagnant for the last half a year as futility sets in. even with all the jogging training, and similar. it was just me...at the 'race', just me at the finish line...and just my brain on the long drive home. 

edit: on of the maddening ideas is doing what many were asked to in primary school, ""draw a picture of who you want to be in the future."" instead, paint how you die. and i envision, if i am still sitting here in 10 years with no change, how much i'd loath myself for not taking action today. i'm a proactive individual and seeing problems down the road usually inspired action today. as you can imagine that proactive plan isn't the best when it comes to self termination. problem is, i see myself as alone, in the same chair i've been sitting for years. it doesn't matter the job or similar, i regret the time wasted...but i know it wasn't, it was spent agonizing over change...change that i can't create, change that is dependent on the actions of others. and being alone...as i have been is not a point i want to meet.

that's how it goes day to day, night to night:

""where do i want to be?""
""with others.""
""am i there?""
""no.""
""did we try something different today?""
""yes, we stopped in the library and tried to talk to people...how rude ha.""
""will it change if the same thing is tried?""
""no, that's insanity.""

imagine doing this every single day...for over a decade. maddening.

so...question to you, if you knew that on the day you died, nothing had changed from today aside from bills, politics, the weather, and your physical age/health, what made the passage of time noticeable?

i was 16, scrubbing toilets at college, was quite content with that. and while walking to work at 4a.m. one morning, i had a bit of euphoria. i liked where i lived, i enjoyed the people i saw while working, i liked being able to walk through the woods, and row on the shores of lake superior...and i'd be content to live this day again with no change. that in that moment, i could see myself 40 year later in the same routine, and it was acceptable.

in that moment, i found peace and thought, 'if i died, today or 40 years from now doing this, it would be the same as dying now.' 

i should have taken than and done myself in then...it's been down hill ever since! ha.


**edit:** for the first time in my life, i had a dream where i found myself, after having failed miserable in front of others to cook something properly, that i found myself banding my fists on the wooden kitchen flood,dropped to my knees shouting!!!! ""i just want to die! i just want to die!"" what a way to wake up. thank you subconscious for the non-subtle imagery.

"what is really the point?seriously? i am failing to see the point in anything. anytime i've tried bringing this up to someone irl, it is shrugged off. i have spoke to my doctor, my mum and whoever else will listen. all i get is ""its gonna get better"", ""here's some different meds"", ""oh stop overreacting"", ""you don't really want to kill yourself"". 

well firstly, it hasn't even shown signs of ""getting better"" and i'm sick of hearing that. if you're going to promise something like that, all it does is get my hopes up for something that never occurs.

secondly, different meds; i've been on several and none seem to alleviate this desire to just end it all. when they stop taking away the desire to do it, it just leaves the thoughts of how i'd do it. so suicidal thoughts without wanting to die. its weird.

thirdly; ""stop overreacting"". what? seriously? this one is my mum. someone who has dealt with mental illness herself. she keeps on brushing it off like i want to feel this way or that i'm doing it for some attention. i am bringing my fears to her and asking for help and sure she might not like seeing her son this way but demeaning the feelings with something like that only makes things worse and feel more lonely. and that adds onto the final point of ""you don't really want to"". why am i being told how my brain works? this isn't a new occurrence. it is constant. i am trying to tell you how i feel but you're telling me ""oh but you don't feel that way"". well there we go, i'm cured because you said i don't feel that way.

i know this seems more like a rant than some form of watching out for suicide, but its this shit that keeps bringing my closer and closer and closer to taking the plunge and doing it. i am so god damn lonely, distressed, completely empty feeling inside and feel ill all the time whether i'm dizzy, sick or something else, it feels so inescapable that death feels like such a freeing idea.

"a collection of thoughts with no directioni don’t know what is happening with me, but i know it can’t be leading to anything of promise. my feelings of suffering are punctuated by small gems of melancholy. this is a turning point. i’ve never felt so close to death. so close to complete and utter emptiness. i don’t quite understand how i can feel so empty but also brimming with rage and with misery. i am constantly oscillating between the extremes, albeit quietly and inconspicuously.  

solitude takes a toll on the mental workings of a person, and while i am physically surrounded by hundreds of people nearly everyday, i am forsaken. i have not one person with whom i can share my thoughts, feelings, or desires. my life is not my own, so i can’t even comfort myself. i am allowed no time to indulge in my own musings, and as such am not allowed the enjoyment of being in my own company. i feel as if any sense of control has been ripped of me, and it shakes me to my heart. i feel lost.

prolonged happiness has always been ethereal. forever untouchable and unattainable. never palpable to my hands and my heart. on occasion, the brevity of true happiness touches me and i feel absolutely moved. the last time i felt something such as this, i was brought to tears. it was overwhelming. i have become so accustomed to the callous despair that envelops my chest and so it has lowered my tolerance for joy in the sense that even the smallest amount takes me aback. 

i fear myself more than anything. i am terrified of the thoughts and insatiable wants that lay within me. once i yield to them, my body and mind recoil. i want to throw up, as if i can purge myself of the feeling. regret devours my very being, slowly dissolving me from the inside out. 

no matter how i try, i can’t imagine my life beyond my early twenties. if i don’t die before then, i don’t know what i’ll do. i am terrified of what lies beyond youth and beyond the age when it is no longer considered normal to be broke and unstable. i can’t see myself as anything but broke, unstable, turbulent, and dying. there is an image in my head that is near constant of a gun, pressed firmly against my temple. cocking it, slowly placing my index finger on the cold trigger. for once, my hands don’t shake.

i often wish i'd get hit by a car or fall victim to some type of freak accident. worse over i wish i were terminally ill. i know how sick and selfish it must sound, but i do. i want to die but don't want it to be at my own hands. i don't want it to be my fault. i don't have the  courage to do that. i care too much what people think of me and i am too fearful of the act itself. my every action and thought is bathed in cowardice. as much as i may want to my life to end swiftly, i am terrified that these are my constant thoughts and feelings. there is that innate part in me that wants to live and wants to fight but it is not strong enough. that part of me is crumbling in my hands.

"don't know if there's a point in posting but i suppose i've got nothing to lose.i tried to kill myself a few months back, basically to avoid being a burden on society because i can't do anything right. i was in the psych ward for a week. i got out. i'm supposed to be better now, and for a while i was, with the exception of an apathetic outlook on life.

a few weeks ago, our door got stuck shut when my cat was outside. i could have gone out through the garage to get him, but i was tired and not the most logical, so i opened the window that was next to the door and tried to lift the screen out. it wouldn't come out, so i forced it out and bent the frame in the process. now it's unusable.

my mom said she wasn't mad, but told me to be more conscientious next time. she was frustrated though, but seemed quick to forgive me for acting rashly.

today i told her about how our cat couldn't figure out which door to use when i called him in, even though he could see me, sort of as a humorous anecdote i guess because our cat is really dumb. but she started going on about how she was irritated that i was acting thoughtlessly and cost her a screen, and that she didn't know where to get one and how i never have to accept consequences for my actions because i'm not a responsible adult. i told her i was really tired and not thinking clearly. she told me, ""sometimes you have to think clearly.""

she asked me to load the dishwasher and went upstairs. well of course during this time all i had to think about was what a fuck up i am, and kept imaging vivid images of my arms covered in cuts and bleeding profusely because that's just what i think about when i feel guilty. she came downstairs and asked me if i had any plans today, but i couldn't answer because i was trying not to cry. then she figured that i was upset, and asked me why. after a long pause i told her that i didn't know she was still upset about the screen.

then she told me about how she had taken years to learn mindfulness, and it just drove her crazy that she had to see all these people go around and make stupid decisions without even thinking. after ranting for a bit, she said she was furious that i went back to my dad's, even after she'd given me this opportunity to have a better life. i couldn't tell if she meant the last time i lived with him or a few days ago when i didn't feel well and stayed with him because my appointment was near his house and i didn't feel like driving back (would have been an hour drive), but i didn't ask.

then she went on about how until i learned to do things for myself, i'd be a burden, either on her or society. she said it takes a lot of practice to be that mindful and to realize what the right choices are, but that every time i get close i just ""throw it all away"" because i want to be a victim or something. she again referred to me choosing to live with my dad (he's controlling and abusive). she mentioned how i can't stay in school and that i'll probably fail the next time i try because i haven't improved.

i don't know if this is her odd way of motivating me. she said i should use these criticisms to realize what's going on and work hard to change. but i've been in therapy since getting out of the hospital to do just that. i thought i was working on changing.

she said she was irritated about the window, but that it wasn't about the window. she asked if i could accept why she was upset. i didn't answer.

the whole time it just made sense to me that i'm a fuck up and she thought of me as a burden. everyone probably does. i tried to kill myself before because whenever i tried to change that, whether that be by holding down a job or going to school, i failed or was completely miserable. so i could be miserable not being a burden or make other people miserable by being a burden, which would also make me miserable, or i could just kill myself now and spare everyone and myself all the misery.

i don't know why i'm writing this, other than to just get my thoughts out there. or maybe there's another solution and i just haven't thought of it because i'm just a thoughtless zombie burden. i'm not sure. all i know i that i hate my life and i'm no longer attached to its existence.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"can't deal with life anymorewarning: past suicide attempt mention and generally fucking annoying


the combination of school, living in this house, and living with ptsd and add is making me want to kill myself. i've wanted to kill myself since i was 8, the earliest i can remember clearly imagining how to. i've already failed suicide twice but since my family hides all the ""resources"" now, there's no real out for me. i'm still looking into it. i don't have my permit or license yet since i failed the learners test the first time. i've been in a constant panic state since 3pm yesterday, it's almost 6am now and i should have been studying for at least some of that time. 


i can't focus in class because of my fucked up ptsd brain, yet realistically i know i wouldn't do much better in the real world with a job. did fine my first semester but now i'm only taking two classes, one in person and the other online, and the one in-pperson class keeps sending me into these anxiety attacks. it's too late to drop, there's only 3 more weeks, but i can't bring myself to go to classes more than necessary. i've already pushed missing class so much. i'm cheating on all of the assignments to get by. i feel so pathetic. 

also my family has no money so i doubt i'll be able to afford books or even attend next semester. so i have to get a job. i don't know how i'll get a job when i have no skills, no positive traits, nothing. i'm nothing and i feel so pathetic. if i went to a hospital again it wouldn't help and would only end up costing my family wasted money they don't have and time. i wish we had the right to choose to die. i want to die. i can't cope with life. i have tried and failed over and over again. nothing is going to get better. i'm almost 19 and literally no part of it has been enjoyable besides the things that bring me out of my life. like sleep, or reading. the only time i felt true, light-headed relief was moments after my second, nearly successful attempt. i remembered absolutely nothing of the unsettling things that happened in the hours after. i want to feel like that again and i know i'll never feel that way without taking action. you don't come across that level of happiness/relief in reality and even if there is a way, i don't fucking care to find it unless it's the end to my story. i don't want to go from that happiness to going back to the regular depression and pain. everything in my life since then has been so miserable in comparison. i wish we had the right to choose to die, because we're going to keep fucking doing it in these painful and horrific ways all alone. suicidal people don't get support, only the illusion of support through years to decades of making them endure therapy and medications that don't work.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"20, maybe 25i just turned 17 and i'm at a very strange point. like, i cant tell. i feel better than i've been feeling; this year i've reached some of my most lowest and most lovely points, but now i just feel almost suspended. suspended between everything, not really numb, just kind of unsure i guess. yesterday i wrote a scattered and half-assed will/suicide note. it doesn't feel as profound as it sounds maybe. maybe it's just that i don't really want to die, but i sure as hell think about it enough.

so, maybe this'll work. maybe this will make something *click* in me. maybe this will end up belonging in r/vent, because i'm going to try wordbarfing into the void.

to begin, i failed my junior year of public school. summer-schooling would've been a bitch and a half to pay for, and even if i could've paid for it, just the mere thought of doing school a day more drove me to complete breakdown. i fought tooth and nail to convince my parents to let me go into homeschooling (with success), and even now, with an opportunity to work at my own pace, i'm still not caught up. i'm still fucking failing. i've never had huge hopes to go to college but this is just fucking ridiculous. *at least get a fucking diploma*, ykno?

no. probably not.

i go weeks, months sometimes, without even being able to *look* at my school laptop. now it just comes down to when my school decides i'm far-gone enough to boot me out.

so, okay! not too faithful about me succeeding in the academic slice of life. so therefore, no likely job, right? how the fuck am i going to manage that, hmm? i don't know. art or writing doesn't seem like it'll give you much of a boost unless you're some prodigy. 

*just wing it*, has been the most useful and most damaging motto, and i will keep on fucking using it.

i also cut off some friends. three close ones, plus some that kinda weren't. when i failed junior year, the following summer ate at me. i isolated myself big-time after a bit, though i guess it was more just me waiting for someone to reach out. no one did. like even the littlest, smallest, most minuscule movement to just tip a care in my direction would have helped. i wouldn't have blamed so much on myself, and i wouldn't have dug myself into such a rut. everyone was *busy.* guess it's the new trend to hang out with your boyfriend every hour of every fucking day, huh. guess it's normal to not just *make time* for a friend? oh! i know, if i've got some weed maybe you'll consider it?

i loved my friends, you know. i was a go-to for advice, a go-to for support. i enjoyed it. kinda wonder if i was just being used, but i also know there was *something* there at one point.

but i have one friend still. she's family, she's my lifeline. she's more than what a lot of people could ask for, and i love her more than i love myself. i'm starting to panic, though. i included her in my will. i wrote my goodbyes and farewells. wanting to die is such a mess. if i live, i'll bog her down. i don't see shit getting better for me. i don't see me even working to make it better. i see me turning into a leech once i find out i can't keep a job, and i don't want her to know me in that way. and when i die, she'll despise me. it'll bog her down. but she's the strongest woman i've ever known.

i gave myself a due-date of 20, maybe 25 if there's a flare of potential. but if i can't get my act together before then, i guess it's another test that i'll be more than willing to flunk.

i've been helping my dad, too. we almost constantly butt heads, and i have a permanently iffy relationship with him, but he's sick. cancer-sick. and my mom works a lot to keep us all going. she's strong too, but she doesn't seem to admire me as much as i admire her.

and it makes sense. i really don't think about them enough. my meltdowns, my panic attacks, my worthless fits. they're both stressed enough. they're trying to convince me to go into the marines. *no,* please. it's never been for me. college? no, sorry. a part-time job? i *tried,* no one called me back! do just *some* school? no, i'm tired, i'm sick,idontfeelgood,ijustwokeup,maybelater,i'vegotplansi'mpreoccupiedi'vegototherthingstodoi'msorry.

no. i'm really, really sorry.

all the fucking excuses, and whining, and all the sheer laziness and lack of motivation to do anything just *fuels* this toxic mindset i have. *not everyone can be a hero*, is a particularly favorite excuse of mine. it's laced with just enough dramatics. it sits super well. a good excuse to not try, a good reason to become a piece of garbage. 

i just haven't been able to seem to care about anything. like, i *do*, i'm able to love and feel shit. everything just has this film over it, and even with these newly prescribed glasses of mine i can't seem to really see any *worth.* why is it worthwhile to stay? as long as i'm here, there's not really a reason. i wish i could just not exist in all this physical world stuff. i want to watch my friend and family grow and get better but i can't do that if i'm going to be the whining, squealing little rat that everyone trips over. 

squeak squeak no longer, r a t.

i don't know what that analogy means, don't question it.

so the only thing that i'm willing to do for myself right now is to just give me time. there might be a revelation, ykno? maybe i'll mature a bit and discover some motivation to fucking *live.* maybe i'll decide to finally not lie to my doctor, but i have to find the courage first. the whole idea of anti-depressants has always scared me. i don't want to feel numb. i'd rather feel the things i do rather than feel reliant? i don't know. maybe that's not how it works or maybe i'll just have to accept that change. maybe i won't do any of it, and not change, and just make a big ol time-leap to my deadline. just wingin' it.

jesus this is awful. fuck. haha i'm really tired. dunno if i should post this because it's basically a garbage fire, and there's heckin' flaws and the worst attempts at jokes, so if you scoffed, i get it. i'm young, pretty fuckin' dumb and naive, and generally awful. whoever reads this probably thinks i've got some mental tapeworms or something. you're probably uh correct. like i could've gone on for years, man. there's just so much. but i think my keyboard has had enough.

it somehow made me really see how much i’m actually capable of loving someone and being able to be committed without fearing it all. 

there had been a few incidents where guys would  try to push my boundaries irl while i was in that relationship with my bf, i always ignored it, used a stern no and walked away and i didn’t put much thought of it.

"decided i’m not living past 18my 18th birthday is in 175 days, that day i’ll also get my atar (basically the day i’ve been waiting for since starting school, it’s your results from your final year)


i have spent every day for the past few months studying for these exams, aiming to do really well and get into a top university. every time i sit and study i get anxious, my heart rate increases, i can’t breathe, chest tightens and my ears go hot and red. i never knew why, and today i realised the reason. it’s because studying isn’t for me, working a 9-5 job, going to university, sitting at a desk for my whole life isn’t for me. i am one of those people you don’t think is depressed from the outside, i’m outgoing, funny, hardworking and friendly. i am so much more than a desk job, than an exam result. 


i thought this realisation would make me happy, i finally know why i’m getting anxious, but it’s made me feel more depressed than ever. i have goals for my end of year results, but without a vision of my future job theyre useless. i can’t see a future for myself, i can’t see a purpose, i can’t see happiness. i’m now stuck between continuing to study when my body physically rejects it or just giving up and regretting not trying for the rest of my life. 


and after all this i realised that i don’t want to be an adult, i don’t want to make decisions, i don’t want to have to plan and think, planning gives me anxiety because the future gives me anxiety. 


i’ve been suicidal before, i’ve been on antidepressants for almost two years, but this time it’s a feeling that’s so real and it feels like this is my destiny, this is my future, this is who i’m meant to be, this is my purpose, to be gone. 


i want to be forever young, forever innocent and clueless and careless. i don’t want to grow up, i don’t want to change. i want to be this way forever, i want to stay like this right now forever, every day that passes is a day i grow older.


most of all, i want to be free, the source of my anxiety and depression is myself, and i can’t escape from myself. i want to let go, to feel nothing, to do what my body and my heart wants me to do. 


soooo long story short i have decided i will not live past 18. i don’t want to be an adult, i don’t want to find out my vce results, i don’t want to make it to 2021.

physics: a bit deeper understanding of the basic laws, interactions, forces, atoms etc. and formulas of how to think of the interactions and forces as a whole that work together.


ethics: different ways of reacting to life (like essentialism, protestantism)


chemistry: basic atom level stuff. different atomic bonds, molecule bonds, allotropy, dispersion force, isotopes, ion bonds, lattice structures etc.


german: (been learning for 9 years) grammatical cases (die die der, der den dem, ein einen einem) and new wordsss


english: (been learning for 8 years) just new words and ways to fuck around with sentence structure


swedish:(been learning for 4 years)  i can't remember but fuck swedish

last year i stopped eating for a while and i lost like 10 kg or something. they were really happy and everyone told me i was much prettier and things. (ik now that my parents apparently thought i had an eating disorder at that time but didnt say anything, prob cause they wanted me to be skinny lmfao) but well well under the summer i regained the weight cause i just realised that i cant walk around without eating ig lmfao so yeah im overweight again. and i have a fucking dentist appointment on thursday (dont ask lmfao) and im gonna get a medicin and theyll need to weigh me. so my parents will hear my weight and bro ik they will hate me so much. idk if ima need to kms before thursday or something cause otherwise ima have to be hated by my parents for fucking years again. and im so fucking scared idk what to do. can someone please just tell me what i should do please this is stressing me out

"dear suicide watch, i am at a loss for myself.i am the cliché strong one. but to this day i am not sure why.

i, as a child watched my family drift away, and return two faced. the actions around myself were never the same around others, even at a younger age i felt this was something i could not respect and instead refused to learn anything about life. i choose instead to spend time to look around me and learn from what i saw, what i felt was right or justified. while this by far does not leave me perfect, it is how i grew and began to learn. 



years later, as a late teen i began to experiance the joys of watching others go through teenage depression. while i could not myself understand their sadness and suicidal urges, i felt it was truly wrong for someone to feel so sad that it was the only way to get away, so i tried and tried as best i could to bring upon myself sadness and grief, to try and feel emotion which i commonly did not feel. after all i knew only myself, and family could not bring out feelings in me. 

even after all these years, as anice almost 25 year old today, i see how much of a strange and poor choice that was. for i felt that sadness, and it ate me alive, but i had nothing to lose. nothing to run from. nothing to fear or hide, nothing to motivate me to take these horrible feelings over the edge. 

there are days i try to grieve, days i feel empty, numb. but u can't figure out why. i for the longest time have hidden this fact from those i helped out of their siutation, because i felt i was the only thing keeping them around, regardless of if that was true or not then, it has been years since i have had these talks. 

i pretend i live for others, or any other reason i can imagine sounds nice, but in the end, i feel hopeless. 

i am stuck,  here, and now, in a world i distract myself not to stop myself, but so that i can have a moment i'm not thinking there is nothing.  

and i wonder, what if i had a reason? a decision i have the freedom to make.

only one thing kept me going through that hell and the physical therapy that allowed me to walk again-my then girlfriend. she cooked for me, helped me shower, and basically everything. it was the only time in my life i felt safe. 

after getting cleared to go back to work, the settlement came through and i had enough cash to pay cash for an engineering degree. i jumped on the opportunity and worked in a machine shop to help my girlfriend get anything she needed. then the auto plant shutdown. i graduated and needed a job. at this point i was engaged to her. i went to work in the oilfields, and made out like a fucking bandit. then one day, on my off rotation, i went back home and something wasn't right. when i hopped on the plane for my 6th hitch, she gave me a long hug. my inner monologue said ""this is the last time.""

and that was the hardest walk i've ever had to make in my life. i got on the plane, went back to the hellhole and then got a dear john letter. i was devastated. the coup-de-grace was getting laid off the next day. 

see, next to my ex-fiancé, the only thing i ever cared about that reciprocated was my line of work. this is complicated by the fact the only reason i stayed alive in the first place is that i knew if i left this world, even with my life insurance and insurance settlement, my fiancé would be alone. so, the only logical decision was to keep suffering and i did, because leaving her alone and confused in the world was not a valid outcome. 

last week, i go laid off for a second time from my temp gig as a cnc operator. i toyed with offing myself, because at this point the only constant in my life is the physical pain and surgical scars from the accident and the morning routine i have to do to get limber enough to move around.

now am i actively going to make abstract art in my bathroom with my brain tissue and cranial structure? no. has the idea crossed my mind? yes. do i like being in a similar mindset that i was a long time ago when i first got injured? no, and i don't know how to fix it.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm screwed in the head.rant. just here to rant. and no, i don't want to talk with you. i just need someone who feels the same way, but my fucked up head gives it no chance.

feeling nothing every day. it starts to become your personality. depression has made me drop so low that i don't care anymore. just another sheep in the herd.

sociability is already tough enough for me. keeping up a fake smile to everyone just to feel your muscles around your mouth relax back into that dead stare. i wish people didn't expect so much out of the other half of society. i'm expected to pass classes, have friends, be a good citizen, keep up with media so you don't fall out of line and all that bullshit. but fuck off with your general view of how people should be. i don't want to become a sheep. i'm a human being with fuckin' independant thinking. slaving 3/5ths of my life away just to be ""successful"" won't cut it out for all the other problems i have with myself.

better yet, being 16, doesn't make any of this get any better. i'm so fucked in the head that i don't even know what's right or wrong, normal or weird, etc. i've started to sympathize with most school shooters. i understand that they've been abused, excluded and bullied to the point where they snap and express it into the worst manifestation. hell, i've fallen to the point where even serial killers (ted bundy and ed gein especially) don't creep me the fuck out. if i was kidnapped by one, i'd just tell him/her to end it because i gave up years ago. death is something i can worry and care less about now. general emotions are something i can never feel anymore, except hatred and misery. emotional suppressing has dropped me to rock bottom. never cried in many years.

social cues are so fucking complex. what do you expect me to do? rub your cock (not literally) so that you don't become bored of my outer shell? i don't fucking understand people. i wish i didn't have to understand people. i wish i wasn't forced into an environment that i absolutely hate. asked for a girl's messenger. we both texted for about 30 minutes. then i fuck it all up by being an annoying prick, leading her to stop texting me. fuck sakes.

if i got 1 a dollar for every time i heard or seen ""it will get better"", i'd be fuckin' middle class poor. it only makes me wonder ""when? when will life stop fucking me over and start handing me good cards?"". people have recovered, some have not.

i've become so pessimistic and skeptical that, everything that anyone tries to compliment to me is all fucking bs. ""you're funny"", but in my mind ""i'm fuckin' not. just a boring, fucked up person"". i wished everyone could just fuck off with their compliments, my mindset doesn't make it sound any good.

parents, adults and other peers won't understand. as obvious as i make it to them, they won't understand me. ""it's just a phase"" ""go out on a walk"" ""do something you love"" ""blah blah blah"". telling me to do something when i have no motivation to do anything at all will never work out, nor will it make me do better, nor will it make me shut the hell up.

i'd have ended myself months ago (hdmi cord). but i've pussied out at every attempt. i started cutting about a month ago. and when i did, it felt great. i was a completely different person, only for that to last for a day and the whole shit comes back down.

"everyone i love is goneit's tiring. every time i invite someone to the closest part of my heart, one way or another, they are ripped forcibly from my life completely. some are by falling outs, some are by things i wasn't involved in, but they are all in the same at the end of the day. 

i've been thinking a lot about my ex-girlfriend whom i loved for a year, before she accused me, and carefully made sure to announce to all of our friends as well, that i both physically and emotionally abused her. i've been thinking about my former best friend -- who, during my aforementioned relationship, attempted suicide -- she had told me about her attempt to my face, after a year of being distant, and i didn't do anything in response. i just gave her the generic ""are you okay?"" spiel and watched as she completely disappeared from my life.

i did a change of scenery, and found a new group of friends who care for me deeply. one friend, my best friend currently, was especially close to me. she did everything in her power and so much just to make sure i could sleep easy at night. we started dating, and it was going phenomenally. but, recently, she broke up with me to get back with her abusive ex-boyfriend, and she has refused to be my friend now.

it kills me to sit here and do nothing for my best friend. i've seen the tears in her eyes when she tells me of all the manipulative shit he's capable of, and i've seen her mouth unable to find words when she wants to find something good to say about him. and, i've found that none of her friends, no matter how close, have been told any positive news about him either. i'm not satisfied with sitting on my fucking hands and hope that i am wrong. but the bridge is burned and i can't do anything anymore.

i don't know how to deal with it anymore. i'm forced to fucking count the people who leave my life and be unable to do shit. i recognize it's not always my fault, perhaps it never was, but it burns to know i had the power to do more  and that i failed. i am vividly convinced that it's all in the past, but i don't know how to put it away, because i don't want to. i always want to believe there's something more i can do. but that is never the case. it never gets any easier, only opens bigger holes each time.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"after almost a year of being a burden, i plan to end my lifei don't know how it got to this. i thought that by moving to the different country i would escape poverty and be useful to society. i thought that i would finally stop being worthless to everyone close to me. i was promised a calm and stress-free life by my parents and peers. to my surprise, none of these came true. 

at the end of last year, i moved to wales with my father, because my mother could no longer support me, so that i could find a job, and, hopefully, get an education. after i arrived, i had to wait an extra 3 months so that i could attend a university interview. because of this, i panicked almost daily. i would wake up with cold sweats, a racing heart, and a foggy head. i could barely get out of bed and go outside to the store. 

when the interview arrived, i passed it without too many issues and was sent an offer which i firmly accepted. however, it turned out that the student financing firm wouldn't fund my course and my anxiety came back with full force. i had to send applications to the nearest universities and all the stress just made me even more deranged. 

at this time, i started sending applications for work, not knowing how to even build a proper cv. i would like to add that i have 0 experience. my first job i got only because of connections and even then, the boss got so mad at me that he kicked me out within 2 weeks and told me never to come near his business.

in my spare time, i just watch youtube videos, and play video games. i am currently learning programming since i will be studying computer science. however, with this large gap on my resume, i don't know how i will ever explain myself to employers. i have no friends. i am a hermit. my dad can barely even support me and it hurts that i can't help him. 

if it wasn't obvious from my ramblings, i am severely mentally ill. i have asperger's syndrome and a range of anxiety and depressive disorders. i believe it is exremely obvious to others around me. after sending hundreds of applications, i received only a few interview invitations, all from which i was rejected afterwards.

i can't take it anymore. i will just make it easier on my dad and poison myself while he is asleep. i have nothing to live for. i will just burden my family even more by being alive. please prove me wrong! please!",suicide,suicide,1.0

i don't know what to do anymore. i'm so sick of living this fucked up life, but i could never bring myself to end my own life. i just keep hoping each day that i'll get run over by a car. i started smoking again in the hopes that i'll get cancer someday, and at least relieve some anxiety quickly. it's pathetic.

i got really sick about a year and half ago during my pregnancy. i almost died (now i wish i did die when it happened), my baby almost died, it was a fucking nightmare. he spent over 3 months in the intensive care unit. i've been running on adrenaline this whole time. it's finally run out, i'm completely burnt out, and i've realized how completely fucked up my whole life is. 

i graduated with a ba just before finding out i was pregnant. i had a semi-shit job at the time, but it got me by just fine. well i've been trying desperately since then to find something worth-while, and there's nothing. my degree has brought me nothing but debt and agony. now i work a slightly better shit job, making $17 an hour but i still can't afford my bills. rent in my area is pretty high, and i've had to use credit cards to cover things like food and gas when i came up short. now they're all maxed out. i'm so behind in everything and i can barely afford food. it's mortifying. i can't even register, inspect or insure my car right now.

i'm married, but my relationship is so fucking dysfunctional. my husband barely helps me pay any bills. we keep going back and forth, splitting up and him coming back. i don't feel like he cares about me or my son one bit. i should probably just end it, but i'm scared and co-dependent and i don't know what to do quite frankly.

back in january i tried staying with my parents for a little bit to get back on my feet, but i ended up getting robbed and essentially trapped there for 3.5 months of misery. my husband's grandfather was hospitalized during that time for 2 months, and we didn't know if he'd make it. my grandfather dropped dead 2 months ago. 

i can't take any more hardship or trauma. that is truly how i feel; traumatized by life. i have panic attacks every day. i hate myself. our entire system in this country is set up to make it impossible to get ahead. i'm one large expense from being in complete financial ruin. i'm 26 years old, and i thought i did everything right. why did this happen? i just want it to stop. the only thing that keeps me going is my son, but even then i feel like i've completely failed him as his mother and he's not even 2 yet. i needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"never thought i would post here. suicidal thoughts won't go away.hi. i'm having trouble. i'm m 22yo, living at home, working, going to school, and playing music in a band. most people would say i have a good life. i'm not a bad person, but there are things about me that i absolutely hate. i'm just worried that, at the way i'm going, everything is only going to get worse. i make terrible decisions. i know i spend too much time thinking about myself. i'm afraid to make new friends, find a girlfriend, and basically do something with my life. i feel like a huge pussy because of all of this. i've been having suicidal thoughts for a couple years, since i stopped swimming pretty much. i feel like i have no purpose. i can't talk to my friends about it anymore, it honestly doesn't seem like i have any sometimes. they all have more important things, and i'm just here. i don't seem to want anything, i just exist. i can't stand this feeling, and i want to know how abnormal it is, or what i can do to escape it. i hate thinking about how of my life i'm wasting like this, and if it is really like this, why bother? on top of that, i'm totally in love with someone i can never have, but am around constantly. i can't see that being positive for my situation, so i thought i'd mention it. i don't think i could follow through with anything, but this feeling is destroying me and i just want help. i want to be a better person, but i don't know how to bring myself to do so. thank you everyone",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i wish i could die, i really really hate myself and i hate my lifeit's like every time i pick myself up something brings me back down. i remember i first started feeling sad somewhere around august 2017 and that everything before then was so good, i had never felt like that then. not long ago i was thinking back years ago when i was a kid like 9-11 years old. i was recalling a really hard time in my life and i realized something. i remember vividly just saying ""i want to hurt myself"" out loud over and over and my mom kept telling me not to say that and at the time i was confused why she would say that. i also remembered how one time i was sitting under the dinner table with a pencil and i had wrote ""i don't like life"" under there and i checked, almost 8 years later and it's still there. at the time i didn't know what depression was, i didn't know a word or something like that existed i guess. idfk i was like 10. i didn't know about that stuff but yet i was saying i wanna hurt myself and i wrote that thing under the table. i was just thinking back and i remembered this and me remembering now, it really makes me think....

 for the past like 3 years my life has been a series of ups and downs with mostly downs being the majority of it and the ups not lasting long at all. i remember i always felt down and sad in late 2017 to like mid 2019 but i never wanted to die, i never wanted to kill myself and i didnt used to cry nearly as much as i do now. it was only until earlier this year that i started crying a lot more and gradually i just kept getting so fed up of everything i just want to die. i used to say that i'll never kill myself as long as there's at least one person who cares about me but now i don't know.. i know if i kill myself i might make my parents and my brother's life worse. maybe my relatives and my one friend who i'm really close to. i don't want to die for their sake or at least i really didn't want to but gradually i just feel like i dont care anymore.

whenever i think about wanting to die i feel so awful. how could i possibly want to kill myself? after my parents put so much time and effort and money into raising me and sending me to school and providing me with food and clothes and stuff. me thinking about killing myself means that i just didnt care and or appreciate all the sacrifices my parents made for me. i do appreciate it though, i really do but i just dont think i can keep this up for much longer...

i'm such a fucking failure i just want to end my life. if i die i might make some people sad but at least i won't be able to feel sad right? this miserable life will be over. i'm turning 18 in 4 months

i'm so conflicted, i want to die. i want to die as quickly and easy as possible. i dont want to ruin other peoples lives because of me dying but i really hate having to keep waking up every day. i wish there were an easy way for me to kill myself quickly, maybe that will help me change my mind",suicide,suicide,1.0

i was talking to my friend about what’s going on with me. all she said was her hours were cut too but she isn’t letting it get the best of her. she lives with her family, i don’t. i don’t have any family or a support system. i literally just moved out of a shelter and i was there for 5 years and i was trying to get an apartment but they didn’t even help me because hiv positive people are the priority. i told my friend i might as well start selling myself for money because i can’t find another job since everything requires experience or college and i have neither. i want to go back to school but i just want someone to give me a chance in the mean time so i don’t have to worry about my bills. my friend then said to me how she doesn’t deal with negativity we’ll and to talk to her when i start to make sense. the truth is i will never make sense because i’m dealing with this on my own and this is my reality. i can be homeless. i barely eat or have any clothes because all of my money goes to rent and the people that don’t even work hard or want to change their lives always get the handouts (i live in new york city). the system  here sucks. i’ve been trying to get help and because i have no dependents i just get swept under the rug

"reasons for not ending itusing a throwaway account. posted this on another sub 





been here in this subbreddit for almost a year now. 22m diagnosed with spd and recently depression. been on medication for a month now. nothing happened. 







for the past 2 weeks i've been seriously and constantly thinking about ending it all. i've distanced myself from almost everyone i knew except some few people. i had always fantasized about my death. methods of doing it, place, time, notes to leave behind..... everything. 







my views on the world, humanity, life in general is dark, nihilistic, somewhat misanthropic and filled with absurdity and abstract thoughts about apocalypse and death. so even if my mood changed and got better somehow, i still doubt that my views on the world and the future would change. 







am not religious but i don't have a problem for not believing in god. tho i can't feel anything about him. 







i don't see a point to continue, i will cause people to suffer my death, especially my mother. she suffered in this world more than i can bare and she's still handling it. she sees me as her source of happiness and meaning. she says words like: ""you're the hope in my life"" ""your the only one who feels me"". her words are what make me guilty or hesitant. tho am not sure if i can keep up with all of this. i wish from the bottom of my heart that she dies so she can rest. i don't see her nor me living is anyway good. me being born was one of the major sources of her suffering. sometimes i even think about killing her so i can just end it so i don't make her sad if i left her trapped here. it's fucked up 






am planning on throwing away everything am attached to. i'll give my guitar away for a friend. i'll announce giving all my books away. i've gathered those books throughout the years from around the world. london, turkey, us, and amazon. they're not much but they're the biggest thing am attached right now. i'll burn whatever left untaken. this image of me burning all the books with bookshelfs' fire is quite appealing. 






after that .... i'll be ready to leave this world







anyone has any reason to why i shouldn't be doing this. because i am little bit hesitant. i don't see any reason to keep living. the world is just boring and everything has already been repeated millions of times. i know where life will lead me and i can imagine myself living for the next 50 years ..... nothing interesting in it.

my whole youth i was bullied by girls because i was ugly. reading stuff like women are attracted to real men during their ovulation doesnt help, but i guess it's for the best if i remove myself from this life. i am a failure in everyway, only one girl ever called me handsome and i guess she was just saying that out of pity.

"i give up...i have always lived for others. i could never see myself living in any other way because doing things because it's best for me only makes me feel bad and unhappy. even my own mom used me as a shield to take my dads yelling and physical violence.
but after years and years of being hurt because of this the only options that is left is for me to change because the trait of wanting to do things for others is unwanted by others, especially because i'm a man. if being a human means thinking about myself first before others i'd rather die.

i don't care what others say. how stupid i sound. i've had enough of that already with people saying i act like an annoying brat and/or i'm only doing this out of selfish reasons. i've never wanted anything from others in return except being treated as a human and not some trash you can throw away.
i have already tried to kill myself several times and i'm probably going to finish the job soon.
there is a lot more to my life than that but people don't care about me and the only reason i write this is because i want to express my frustration about people not ever being thankful towards those who care and do not ask for anything in return.

sorry for taking up time from whoever read this. if people want to tell me their lies about how they care about me (a person they have never met) go ahead, but i'm probably going to be dead by then anyway.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i had found a new determination in life, and i desire to stay around a little longer then what i had initially planned. since this month started i’ve gone though many changes, and i had nobody and i didn’t want the help. things are different however.

i want to be the freest person in the world. not bound by things like, race, religion, gender, and disability. i want to help people, because i’ve already been freed from my suicidal thoughts. that’s thanks to everyone here who helped me, and the one friend who stayed by my side till this moment. 

things aren’t all bright and sunny just yet however, since i didn’t expect to be alive right now... i kinda didn’t buy enough food beyond that point. so i haven’t eaten much lately; there’s also another thing that needs to be done. i hurt my very best friend in the whole world. i made her cry, and i’m still full of regret because of that. i want to make it up to her, so we can be friends again.

"im just 16 and already completly desperate about anythinghello reddit,
first things first: i am a 16 years old male in germany.
i think this might be the most fitting sub to explain my situation into. please excuse any grammar mistake that may occur, english is not my native language.

basically i am in german highschool in 11th grade from 12. school is doing good and im actually not stupid or anything - if i would focus on school it would be really easy. but there is the problem. my feelings for in my opinion useless stuff prevents me from focusing on basic and important stuff. as you may imagine, me being in school, im get in touch with a lot of other people, but what i've read the last 2 years i seem to be extremely introvert and shy on top of that. my self esteem is basically non existent and it makes every move i take really hard.
to fight that i am regularly going to the gym but that doesn't help much i think.
friends i made over the years (somehow) start doding me and don't really hide it - they go party without me, don't involve me in stuff and so on.. im losing touch to them and actually start not liking them.

me being introvert and shy makes me completely isolated from girls and i can't help it but i like girls, or try to like on enough to maybe get into an relationship. because that is one ""useless"" thing that bothers me a lot and basically makes life really hard. i wasn't in any relationship my entire life, although i don't look that bad (i think) and having a healthy and sharp mind. i can make people laugh when im comfortable but nobody seems to appreciate that. 

at the start of this year school we got a new girl into our grade, and man i really like her. she seems completely fitting to me, e.g. she is browsing reddit. i messaged her but made the situation already really weird and having speak to her in real life once. awkward as fuck. but that's how my entire life goes actually.

i like wasting my time in bed and laughing about suicide memes, making me think to commit it as well. our financial state in the family isn't the best and i have to work on my own for anything i want to buy.

as a last statement, even if i repeat some things from above: im getting more and more socially awkward and getting less and less contact with other people. my thoughts and feelings are all towards that one girl somehow and i try to tell myself that this is really stupid and i should focus on important stuff, but that just doesn't work. a lot of my thoughts also tend to suicide. an easy way out. just no worries anymore. 

now im stuck in this cicle of me hating myself. i read some other threads in r/askreddit and some talked about just keep in living and just let yourself surprise what might happen next. that's on what im living atm.

maybe you got some tips for me or some solution.

"bullied by my little brothers bullies i was an 18 yo girl and my brother was 11. he was bullied pretty badly by a boy in his class and was even scared to walk home from school. one day i decided to teach the little brat a lesson. i went to their school when they quit and started following my brother from a distance, hoping the bully would appear. eventually he did and as he started pushing and beating my brother i ran up to them. i had never seen the kid before, he looked like a classic bully, big and almost obese. i started yelling at him, telling him to leave my brother alone and so on, but he wasn't scared at all. he just laughed and said something rude, and then he pushed me up against a tree really hard. as i tried to break free the stupid brat grabbed my panties and gave me a wedgie! i screamed in shock (and pain) and cried out for my brother to help get him off me, but he was just standing there and didn't know what to do. the boy told me i should mind my own business (and to be honest i wished i had). luckily at this point a car came by and the boy let me go. me and my brother ran the rest of the way home and i told him we'd never speak of this again... i was so embarrassed, getting owned by someone that young! don't know how to handle it though tl;dr tried to help my brother but got my ass kicked instead",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

my fiancé of 1 year left me, out of the blue. i was still in the honeymoon stage, and i truly believe she is my soulmate. i already suffer from clinical depression, so this was just the cherry on top.

she still calls me on the phone, texts me and acts like we're best friends. she said she just needs time to figure out what she wants. i'm pretty sure she isn't messing around with anybody though (she isn't that type.) i know talking to her is bad for me, but i don't know if i could take losing her.

everything i do reminds me of her. i was on 4chan... 4chan. and a thread made me start crying because it reminded me of her. i can't... um.. touch myself.. without thinking of her and i start crying. even writing this now is painful.

honestly, i wanted a future with her. a home. children. i was so emotionally invested in her. i gave her my entire heart, and i love every thing about her. i've always done everything i could to make her happy. and now i'm broken.

some cute girl was flirting with me, but all i could think was ""she's not her. all i want is her.""

i'll never be able to love someone else. she was absolutely perfect. i'll forever be comparing other girls to her.

i've been severely depressed for so long, and she was the only reason i got up in the morning. i don't know how i'm going to get on without her. i'm 18 (and female) and after i tried to kill myself several months ago, i dropped out of high school. i could never go back.

i have no friends, no family who cares about what happens to me. i spend all day every day alone, in my room. sometimes i sleep all day, or i watch movies, or i go on reddit. but i don't want to live anymore. everything hurts too much.

it’s been almost 3 weeks since i lost her. my best friend. my partner. my world. i know you should not make someone the focus of your happiness. but what can you do when you’re around that person and they just make everything so much better. it’s been 3 weeks since she left me. we stayed in contact but the pain is too much. i finally asked for some space, but that’s only after days of her saying that’s probably what we should do. i had to ask for it.i just keep getting sicker and sicker. eating less and less. feel like constantly throwing up. feels like i’ve been torn apart. i love her so much. i regret even asking for space. i miss her so much. just hearing her voice calms me down. she had my whole heart. still does. no one could ever compare to her. she is so beautiful and special. and now i have probably lost her to someone else. people constantly tell me to just move on. that there are other girls out there. more fish in the sea. but i don’t want to move on. she’s my love. there are other girls out there but what has that have to do when she’s the girl i want to be with and love. there is plenty of fish but she’s the only fish i want. they say with time things get better. while it’s still fresh. i just feel like i’m getting worse and worse. 

i can’t stand the fucking pain anymore. i don’t know what to do anymore. only reason why i haven’t cut again is because i know how disappointed people will be of me. but i can’t take it anymore. i feel like cutting is the only way as i cannot stand this fucking pain. i’ve felt pain before but never like this. i just want to leave everything behind. just cut and cut again. i just want to feel something else. i wish i didn’t feel anything anymore. 

i’m sorry.

"i’m scared i’m still abusivewhen i was younger, not on meds and out of control, etc.; i was really abusive to friends and family and my boyfriend at the time. i constantly think about suicide, i still do, i got diagnosed with chronic suicidal ideation so that’s not gonna change. i also have bpd. 
but when i say younger i mean, like, 13/14/15. i’m 17 now and i’m terrified i’m still that way. someone i had cut out for being toxic tried to get into my friend group and i couldn’t handle it so it split the friend group up. they said i was abusive. and i know i’m not really getting any detail, i don’t really need anyone to msg me on this. 
i just want to die. ever since they accused me of being abusive i can’t function. it’s as if i’m so scared to talk to anyone in fear of being that person. i can barely do schoolwork, i can’t eat i can’t sleep and i can’t work — my job is as a cosplay model, and i love it, but whenever i go to work on my wigs i just... can’t. there’s like a block.

"i have a child with a woman i don't love and i'm stuck in relationship prison. ending my life is the only fair way outin a relationship with a woman who has a vastly different linguistic and cultural background to me. neither of us is remotely fluent in each others language but the relationship somehow worked for the first two or three years.

but i slowly came to realize i wasn't in love anymore. i was staying in the relationship out of a combination of fear of being alone and lack of courage to finish it. 

we continued having sex once or twice each week even while i didn't feel happy. our contraceptive method failed and now we have a child together.

i am 29 but i never thought i'd be a dad. i love my daughter and she is nine months old. i find the loss of individual identity as a parent very challenging but there are positives to being a dad.

any positives though are outweighed by the fact i am stuck in relationship prison. it would be unfair and a dereliction of duty as a dad to end it with my partner now. it would also mean possibly losing access to my child and having her grow in from a different country to me. so i need to stay with my partner.

but staying in this relationship is making me miserable. we barely talk to each other except when playing with our baby. i think daily of how unhappy i am.

i envy every single person who is in a happy, passionate relationship in which they have fulfilling conversations with their partners.

deep down i want to be single while also playing a big part in raising my child. but this is not possible. i am caught between a rock and a hard place.

i wake up every day knowing it'll be a struggle not to end it and i see taking my life as the only reasonable way out. if i am not meant to ever be happy, then i'd rather not live. as much as i love my baby it is impossible to feel happiness in an unhappy relationship. my child would be better off in the long run without the negativity of an unhappy parent.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i'm massively in debt and i'll never be able to repay it. i have no skills, no education, no motivation. i've been working minimum wage jobs since i was 16. i had to move back in with my parents who i can't stand; they're actually alright people but they have undiagnosed mental health issues and my dad thinks my depression and anxiety is a bunch of bullshit and that i use it as an excuse to be lazy. they're retired and have very little money, and i'm a huge financial burden on them. 

i am lazy as shit. i cant even put my clothes away, my room and my previous apartment are fucking messes. i'd rather lie down and stare at the wall. 

i have a fuckbuddy who i have feelings for, but i know he doesn't really care about me. he talks to me enough to keep me on the back burner so he can get his dick wet when he wants. i mean, he's actually a nice person, but he's a little younger and i've been around enough to know when someone genuinely cares about me or not. so he wants to fuck, and i oblige, because i have very few people i can talk to and at least i can have some real human contact when i'm with him. 

i can't afford to move out, because my shitty retail job only gives me 25 hours a week and even if i were to land an interview doing something worthwhile, i'd probably end up skipping it or fuck up badly during it. i just don't care about myself. i want to care about myself. but i don't.

and yet, the bus is still there. i cannot tell it to go away, because next time i might be brave and put both feet on its worn floor. i feel bad about the lives and loves that i'll be leaving in my wake, and maybe if i was a better person by even a fraction i'd stay for them, i'd endure the mood swings and the craziness for them so that they wouldn't feel the pain. i'm really not that good of a person. 

this feeling might not even last, maybe in an hours time i'll be so hyper i need scrapped of the ceiling, maybe the energy that lets me even contemplate moving at all will disappear and i'll be left alone with just the voices and the darkness. that's the thing i don't know and it drives me mad, my episodes are getting worse and more intense with a propensity for a unique and fun combination of any and all moods. i can't be bothered with it anymore. there is so much that is good and beautiful and magical in my life but somehow eventually bipolar always finds a way to destroy it.

"hey r/suicidewatch. back again, for being a complete ffing idiot.so it's been some time. my therapy has been working. but it all came crashing down.


so, it's valentine's, right? all my friends are out together, on dates, whatever the fuck they do, and i'm sitting here, like a complete total fucking idiot. i go look at my phone, and tell everyone i will ask this person out for 10 bucks, like the fucking idiot i am. j than think i should make a new fucking story and group text, like the also fucking idiot i am, and as soon as i post, it i take it back, but it won't delete it. everyone opens it, looking at it, then they all start texting me shit like, wow you fucking poor bitch, if you need money to get girls you don't need any, or, ""wow. make a fucking conversation and don't even talk in it. just fucking leave. you pussy."" and i tell people i'm sorry, they don't care. i deleted the app. now i'm afraid when i go back to study hall tommorow they'll all be pissed at me. i just wanna die now. someone fucking end this shit.",suicide,suicide,1.0

do people ever commit suicide on the fly without explicitly making any plans to?

at the most actively suicidal i’ve ever felt, i knew it would likely happen that week given how hopeless i was, but i was kind of just waiting for the right moment (whatever that means). i guess i had the method sort of down.

what scares me is not so much that my “baseline” mental state constantly has suicidal thoughts. it’s been like that for as long as i can remember. what does though are moments where i’m present with myself (either being neutral/meditative, or generally just okay and feeling content) and that emptiness and hopelessness creeps in so fast that i hardly notice until it’s too late. i’m afraid that one day i really will just say “screw it,” sick of the constant battle with myself, even if just an hour earlier i was doing so well.

i’m okay right now, not feeling actively suicidal or anything. i’m back in therapy and taking my meds regularly. i just feel like my future is going to be bleak no matter how much i accomplish, do good, or am loved etc. it’s something i’ve always wondered.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i think suicide is the only answer.well, i think it's the end of the road for me. depression surely packs a punch, especially if nobody bothers tp give a shit about me. my girlfriend tried to cheat on me, but i had to cry my heart out to beg her to stay. now that she's back, i thought things would get better. instead, she misunderstands me half of the time, making me look like the asshole. all of my friends say that i'm a big dummy, but i love her more than myself. when i try to share what i feel, she turns the situation around. and i think she's right. i think i'm a good for nothing person. since god is so generous, my family always blames me for all the problems that they have, evem though i'm the one busting my ass out to help them. there are no words to describe what i feel. earlier, i told my gf that everyone in my life is only there to make me feel like shit. again, she misunderstood me, saying how dare i say that she made me feel like shit, because she just wants me to be happy. she told me that this is the most painful thing that i said to her... i just want to die. i have no hope left.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my life is practically over...i've officially lost all hope. two days ago, i got the worst beat-up of my life. i live in a very conservative and traditional middle eastern home, and my family thinks of me as a whore. my brother's friend claimed that he slept with me, and my brother didn't think twice before believing him. he went through my private chats and beat me with the intention of killing me. he then dragged me down a flight of stairs by my hair... i managed to escape, and am away from home for now. 
i seriously don't know what to do, or where i'll go when my options of places to stay run out. my family is taking his side, and he's threatening to literally end my life. i'm tempted into going back home and letting him kill me, but i don't want to die that way. it seems to me that suicide is the only way out, really... there are just so many ways to do it, and not enough reasons not to.

"how much longer do i have to hold on and keep failing until something good happens?for the past year and a half i've only made bad career decisions, one after the other, and went through a company going bankrupt. i didn't manage to do anything i wanted in my personal life (trips to see family at least) because the work issues killed all my plans.  

i have good years of experience and they don't seem to matter. i've gone through extremely shitty recruiters, some who have put me through miserable interviews because they misinterpreted what the company wanted (say they wanted an accountant and they sent me, an account manager). my self esteem is nonexistent. nothing i've done is good enough. i can't see how i could change things. i finally found a job below what my experience would say and i dread it going south, like everything so far. i settled for it out of desperation, whatever, it's fine if that was all i could do, i haven't yet started but i have no hope for it. i've stopped having any hope or positive thoughts because every time i'm disappointed. every damn time. 

whoever says that your job is not your identity and you have to focus on everything else good in life hasn't had a bad run with jobs and unemployment. i have an so, friends and a (far away) family, but they don't help when you're a fucking failure who can barely find a job to survive, despite years of experience.

i'm only not killing myself because it would hurt my so and my parents. i wish i could. i'm so tired. i'm starting to fantasize about how i would do it and how it would work and they're all that's stopping me. but i so want to stop existing.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i've wanted to die since i was a kid. the only thing that makes me happy is music. friends, family, people i know tell me i'm good and i can make it someday. but i know its just wishful thinking.

"guys, i need your advice... i've lost my dad for almost 7 month now, he passed away due to sickness.
and i lost one of my grandma last week (my father's mother).

i don't know if i'm mentally strong enough now, but i'm at a point where i don't know what to do anymore with my life. i mean i'm living with my mother, i have some friends at school, i'm still in very good terms with my brother and my sister, all of this is very fine, but i'm mentally not doing good. i'm crying almost every night alone in my bed.i'm 18 and i've been single my entire life because i'm too shy, and i'm afraid to bother girls i found cute because i have too much respect for them, which kinda sucks because i'm feeling alone and that's hurting a lot, and especially when i'm seeing that all my friends are in love with someome else...

tbh i'm that type of friend who is the funny guy at school, but when i'm at home, i'm not good at all, because i have almost no friends to talk to. i'm spending a lot of time on my computer playing video games with my best friend trying to get away from the reality, but it's not always working.

i think your telling to yourself ""why don't you go speak to your family or friends"" and that's true, but i don't want to do it because i don't want my mother my brother and my sister to be worried about me because they were a lot recently for my dad, and i don't want to talk about it to my friend because i don't want to bother them with my problems, they probably have some on their side.

i rather talk about this to strangers, because i'm not getting the feeling of being judged, that's why i'm posting here.

what counts as an alcoholic/nobody thinks i need help apparentlyi'm 19 years old female and for the last year and a half maybe two years i've been drinking heavily. when i say heavily i mean i will buy a gallon of liquor and by the end of the night (often times alone) there's a little less than half the bottle left. when i don't drink i get itchy and shaky and i can't think. this is now but at my worst i've drank a fifth every night for months and when i tried to stop i thought i was having a heart attack and i had a delirium episode where i couldn't think or speak and i was just shaking. now it's lessened but i still can't go more than one might without getting blackout drunk. i also have struggled with doing cocaine in month long binges until i feel like i'm on the verge of death and i force myself to stop for at least a month. but people tell me i'm too young to be an alcoholic or a drug addict. i feel that it's overtaken my personality so first and foremost i'm a drinker and drug user and secondly i'm whatever person i used to be. i need help and i don't know where to go i went to the er a couple weeks ago for a suicide attempt but got no help and i'm at the end of my ropes i honestly want to end my life. i'm sorry i'm drunk as i'm writing this.,suicide,suicide,1.0

"i wrote this small thing; i'm not suicidal but it helps me when i get overwhelmed, maybe it'll help you too: let me tell you about the home that’s waiting for you.but this is a secret, so you can't tell anyone. 

i need you to go to a very quiet place.

preferably the middle of the night. don’t be scared, i’m going to take you away soon. 

are you there? is it dark? no one’s awake? it’s just you?

good.

i want you to close your eyes.

now, imagine a grassy field in the evening. it’s a summer night, there’s a warm breeze in the air. 

lay gently on the ground, press your body into the earth, feel the prickle of the blades, the coolness of the dirt.

look up. i mean my god, even my heart skips a beat it’s so beautiful. the stars littering the purple-black sky, twinkling over your head like a dome. raise a finger and point to one of them, right above you.

there. right *there*.

that’s where we’re going. oh, you won’t believe how beautiful it is there, how long we’ve been waiting for you to come home.

the most important thing though is you have to believe. if you don’t believe in us, if you open your eyes, if you start falling again, then this can’t work. i need you here. with me. i’ll be right there leading you, okay?

okay.

so you’re in the field. prickles on your legs, soft and gentle as the grass sways to the breeze. you’re barefoot, it feels so calm, there’s no one for miles. move with the wind, slowly, gently, sway. there’s a quiet in the air that’s a type of music, slow, ethereal almost.

you’re lifting slowly from the ground. don’t be scared, don’t fight it. breathe in the air, the crispness like a cold water on a sweltering day, flooding your lungs. the ground is getting further and further away, you’re floating, up, up

up

up

you’re so high in the air now that the field is getting smaller, like a spec. but it’s so vast, a reflection of the sky that there’s nothing for miles. look up, you’re leaving earth. the air is changing, colder, clouds are around you like wispy smokes. the procession is starting. i told you we’ve been waiting for so long.

the starts are twinkling in a dance, the smoke surrounds your body, weaving through your hair, lifting it up like it’s defying gravity. you’ve left earth, the round blue ball hanging in the middle of the universe.

this galaxy is so big, you can see that now, right? all our worries that seemed so big in that grassy field is nothing but a drop in existence, nothing but a ball you can kick away into space if you wanted.

the stars are around you, glittering, quickening like they know their sibling is finally coming back to them. you’re levitating, spinning in the air, there’s no gravity here, no need for any laws that anchor us below. 

we’re here, we’re home, you feel us, so warm. we scream, we laugh and the sound reverberates through worlds and galaxies. i hold your hand, firmly, brush your palm, draw out your name, my love, my best friend, my being, my own. we’re made of the same things you and i.

and you feel peace, finally, inevitably, this is what you were longing for in those moments when you peered through the worlds, when the veils lifted, fluttering through the wind. you cried and sobbed for this, didn’t know quite what you were looking for, didn’t understand why your chest hurt. and we saw you and we cried, and the rains came, some stars blew out they were in so much pain at your agony, we wanted to reach you. water poured, drenching your world, lightning flashed. did you get our message?

my name is angelique, i'm fourteen years old, and i don't know what to do anymore.

my life has been so messed up. i know that is harsh, and i know people have been through much more than me, but i am in **so much pain.** 

i won't go into detail right now, maybe another time, but everything is so hard right now.

i feel like i'm never going to be happy. ever.

i started cutting at the age of nine, and since then i have done so much to myself, that i'm  not entirely sure who i even am anymore.

i just want to cry, or scream.

i want to fall asleep and never wake up.

i know that i am just an annoying, worthless child, who's girlfriend secretly hates her, and who can't do anything right.

i don't want to be here, but i'm not sure if i want to die.

dying is such a terrifying thought to me, or, i guess, sad. 

the fact that one i am dead, i am dead, is horrible. i don't want to hurt my parents, because deep down i know it would break them to pieces, but, i'm not sure what to do anymore.

i am on medication, and i go to therapy regularly, but it isn't doing anything anymore.

"i thought i was getting better?hi suicide watch. i'd just like to make the disclaimer that at this exact moment i am not suicidal. i have been before, fortunately (i think) i made it through, and i am trying to prevent myself from getting back to that point. throwaway because i don't want to be reminded of this if/when i make it through. 

i have been living with depression for the past 2-3 years and just this past summer i got the help i needed from the proper professionals. i was getting better with the help of meds and changes in lifestyle. unfortunately that was a short lived and  in march of this year i attempted to end my life. i made it through and about the time i did, i met my most recent significant other. from the beginning she helped me. she knew that i had issues and problems and helped me all that she could. she was exactly what i needed at the exact time i needed it. she may very well have saved my life. on monday out of the blue she ended things with me and i can feel myself slipping back to the state that i was in before meeting her. it's since come to light that she left me for a man 10 years younger than her.  i feel like i've failed her and myself. i can't blame her. she said that my mental health as well as the long distance relationship we were in was too hard. i know that in this case i was far too dependant on someone else for my happiness but at the time, i felt like that was my only option. i'm lost and scared and i don't want to ever go back to that because i know next time i might not be as lucky. 

i'm not interested in making amends with her or getting back together with her. if she thinks so little of me to just throw everything away like that, i know the breakup is a good thing. i just want to not feel like i felt before.

i attended the swanson school of engineering on a whim, and found myself in a depressing city with broken people. my relationships have been uninspired, my jobs all dead-end, and i can't help but realize that i'm the constant factor. i only have superficial interests, spend my days watching youtube videos ad nauseam, i think the site preys on the bored and the depressed alike. i spend my days entertaining myself, and think that maybe my secret passion is entertaining others. i'm definitely critical, so maybe i can be a writer, director, or even a youtuber.

irresponsibly, i bought a condensor microphone and wrote a script, i wanted to make someone laugh. after a week of struggling to release my first 2-3 minute video, i've realized that anything i'm going to want to do will require hard work. i feel like i just don't have it in me, 5 years of misery has beaten all the joy out of my life. i kicked a 9 month spice/bath salts addiction years ago, but find that i'm still that weak piece of garbage waiting for the next source of entertainment.

yea, i'm gone. hard to believe, right!? no, not really. right now you are doing one of two things, either asking what you could have done differently, or be celebrating. 
honestly, you should be celebrating. ""yay! no more having to pretend to like that guy at work!"" i get it, i've seen it, you've said it even if you didn't mean to. 
for those of you asking what you could have done differently, maybe once asking how i was really doing would have been a great start, maybe it wouldn't have helped, i don't
know, remember that mask i talked about earlier, yeah that. 

i loved the work, i begged for it, pleaded for it daily. work got me through the day with some sort of feeling of accomplishment. i could see most didn't care about that
work, nor did they understand it. i get it, it's fine, ""x doing x things"" and such. i was never looking for the center of attention or all the praise, although
sometimes it may have seemed that way. i tried to do what i thought was best, sometimes that failed, sometimes it succeeded, in my mind it was never good enough. 

let me explain why, so that you can stop asking that question. 

i couldn't stop the racing thoughts. hour over hour, minute after minute, second after second, my mind raced with all sorts of thoughts. between my past where i struggled
with my size in middle school, to my academic failures in high school, to my failed relationships, to my failure as a leader in this air force, it all came and went in 
fleeting moments every day. it wouldn't stop.

let's be honest, i struggle with my size now but its become a part of me that i can't change so whatever. 

maybe i'm crazy and looking at everything through a fogged lens. if that was the case then i'm damaged goods and something that can't be repaired. trust me i've thought

watching you grow up, i remember it all. my mind has been so muddy and confused for so long, my body hurts, and my spirit is broken. i love you. 

i love you. remember that. maybe i didn't always show it, maybe i wasn't as appreciative as i should have been, but believe me when i say i was always thankful.

"should i call the police if my best friend tells me she wants to commit suicide?there's a group whatsapp chat between me and my three best friends. i'm going to give them pseudonyms to preserve their identity. we have shayla (me), gertrude and camille. camille has been clinically depressed for a couple years now. since early last year, on multiple occasions, she has texted suicidal ""goodbye"" messages to the group, thanking us for all we've done for her, but saying she's made up her mind and she wants to end her life, even though she knows it's a selfish thing to do. 

now of course we lose our fucking shit every time and go into a panic attack. because we never know if she's just saying it, or if she's actually going to do it. so here's the thing. every time she says she's going to kill herself, she never actually does it, and wakes up the next morning apologising and saying she felt ""posessed"" when she texted us the suicidal messages.

this has happened at least five times. but frankly speaking, this cycle of staying up til morning to make sure she's fine and doesn't do anything stupid is extremely exhausting. because i live near her, i end up rushing to her house to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid. everyone kind of knows she isn't going to do it but nobody wants to take chances either.

so here's where the disagreements start. i've decided that the next time camille sends us a ""i'm going to kill myself, i love you all and thank you for all you've done"" i'm going to call the fucking police. i don't give a shit if she hates me for it, or if she decides to cut me out of her life. a mad friend is always better than a dead friend, and i don't want to be responsible for her death, and know that i made an assumption that she wouldn't kill herself, but ended up doing it anyway. 

now gertrude, the other friend, is telling me i shouldn't. she says leaping to call the police is not a good idea. she says i should find out more information first, then decide to make the phone call. her stand is that we should personally would talk to her more and try to assess how serious she is, rather than leaping to dial, because we're not experts. gertrude believes that bringing the police in will potentially make things more complicated for everyone including us, her parents and her family. 

now the part that really ticked me off was when gertrude said that i needed to be realistic, and make educated guesses considering that camille often claims she wants to kill herself but ends up not doing so. gertrude is basically saying, she's not going to do it.

while i understand where gertrude is coming from, i see this as an incredibly idealistic way of looking at the situation. perhaps i am too rational, but hear me out.

1) calling suicide prevention in my country will not get her immediate help. the police respond much faster.

2) the suicide prevention website in my country states that if we know someone is in immediate physical danger, we should call the police immediately. 

3) the police are trained to do mental wellness checks and can respond to suicide.

4) i come from a first-world country that has generally competent police.

5) trying to talk her out of it over the phone is not helpful either, because god knows what she could decide to do while we are not present. (camille self-harms) i am not a hero.

6) of course, if camille's parents are around to help her, i don't need to do anything because her parents know how to handle the situation. i'm talking about situations where her parents are not present/sleeping and can't help her.

7) i am not interested in making assumptions about camille's wellbeing. i am also not an expert, and i don't think i am qualified to ""assess"" the situation to determine whether i should or should not call the police. i'd rather just call and let the police experts take it from there.

8) i sincerely believe that i should act on what camille says, rather than speculate her intentions.

i am very aware that the actual chance of her committing suicide is not very high. regardless, i do not intend to be stupid. 

maybe i'm fucking selfish because i don't want to feel guilty for not calling the police when i could. 

please give advice because i don't know what i should do. i don't want to do anything that would be emotionally damaging. much help would be appreciated.

"step-dad with ptsd threatening suicidehey guys, first of all i'd like to thank you all for what you all do all the time, helping people here and such.  you are all amazing people for dedicating your time and efforts for such a noble cause.


i come to you today as a quite happy person, but i'm worried about my step-dad.  he's like a second dad to me.  


he's a war veteran from desert shield and suffers from some ptsd.  his (to my mom and my knowledge) ptsd is very episodic and rare; maybe twice a year.  it seems that when work and life gets very stressful for him, the combination of that stress and possibly some alcohol triggers some bad ptsd attacks.


usually they're the typical ""i need my gun"" types, but a few nights ago he was talking purely about suicide.  he came home fairly drunk from a friend's house, and kept drinking here at home.  then my mom and him got into a confrontation and she hit him, which triggered a huge psychological freak out as he was abused as a child and in the marines.   he started saying that he is never happy and hasn't been since he was 19 (before the marines).  he was repeatedly saying that he was just going to go to the local gun store and just get a shotgun and end it.  needless to say, my mom and i are **very** worried.  


this was two days ago, and after a day of rest (yesterday) he seems almost completely back to normal.  this *has* happened before (threatening suicide) about a year ago in a similar situation, but i'm just really worried that it's something that he thinks about more often than he's expressed.  he's always reluctant to get any type of psychological treatment, but does do monthly trips to the veteran's hospital for treatment.


we're trying to keep a close eye on him, but do you guys have any suggestions on gauging how ""recovered"" he really is from this episode?  or any ways to try and help him?  we are going to do all we can to get him to start more treatments at the va but i'm afraid that this new attempt to control his behavior and force him to see therapists could make things worse.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i dont know what i'm thinking.his might end up being a wall of text, so i apologize in advance.

my life has been crazy these past few months, and it's a bit of a long story... so, about four or five years ago (i will be 20 next month), i met and ended up in a relationship (with somebody who i went to an elementary school dance with in earlier years, just so you know how long we have known eachother.) we had alot in common, music, arts, movies, things along those lines. we both were edgy kids who cried about our depression and slit our wrists because fuck living. we both were ""in love"" with each other (we were both 14 at the time) and it was really a good experience. we eventually started going back and forth for a few months and eventuality split up for mutual reasons. i never really lost feelings for her. i'd harm myself because of this almost daily throughout high school, and my depression bloomed. she knew i still had feelings but she was doing her own thing and i respected that. 

i went through a traumatic phase at the age of 14, and started meeting with men from the internet, and had sex. i did this at my own free will through an app. i claimed i was 18. these men were sometimes older than 40 and i regret this every day that i am alive. i feel as though i was taken advantage of at a very young age. this occurred for about 2 years. i kept this a secret. i have never been tested for stds because i am scared, but i dont believe i have any symptoms.

skip to senior year in high school, we never really stopped talking, kind of more of acquaintances then friends but we still knew what we were doing with ourselves. i watched her go through an abusive relationship which lasted a few years, and it really hurt to watch, i feel like i could've saved her from that. we eventually ended up having a class together, and we started talking alot more. long story short we ended up going to prom together and i had a really good time, i thought things went well. dropped her off at her house and gave her a hug. i went to hangout with some other friends afterwards, who let me know that she actually went to go talk to her ex (the abusive one) after i dropped her off, and they ended up getting back together, the night of prom. this was the start of my darkest time. why didnt she at least tell me? why do i even still have feelings for her? whatever. we stopped talking for the rest of the school year and never really talked again.  my self harming never stopped and got exceedingly worse. i had deep cuts on both arms from elbow down, i stopped caring about everything, and all i wanted was to end my life. i still worked at my shitty part time job. i ended up doing alot of drugs (snorting/popping pills, cocaine, bud) after graduating and stopped talking to everyone i knew. i became even more alone and developed crippling social anxiety. 

a month short of a year ago, i got a new job that paid decent money, my self harming still didnt stop and i still had feeling for this girl. she broke up with the abusive guy about a year after graduating and got right into a new relationship with another guy. we still didnt talk but i still knew how her life was going. a few months into my new job, it turns out she also got a job at the same place. my plan was to kill myself before she started, but i couldn't pull through. we also had a mutual friend who also worked there, which made it a little better in a sense that i would be involved in conversations with her, but worse in a sense that i would have to endure being in her presence. all i thought about everyday was that ending my life would be the only thing that could really make my happy. she was still with her new bf and always complained about him to me, i started giving her support and advice and we started regularly talking. we had conversations about our lives and had a better understanding of eachother. eventually. they ended. and i confessed to her how i felt. we had a discussion after work one night that contained how we felt about each other. it turned out she had feelings for me, and i was astonished but didnt act on anything yet since her wounds from her last relationship were fresh.

 a few months down the line. we've been talking and becoming pretty close. one night after work she wanted us and a few people from work to go to a 24/7 dinner. we went and she was being super flirty the entire time, the night ended with us in my car, since i drove us there and ended in a kiss. it was little awkward, but it was the happiest i've been in years. we've been close since then and basically act like a couple (kissing, cuddling, ect
..) and i was the happiest i've been in years. but i still continue to have suicidal thoughts. i still have not been checked for stds. i still think about when i was younger. i'm still anxious, depressed, and i fucking hate myself. 

recently we were alone in my car together (as usual after leaving work and parking up somewhere since it would be too late to go to either of our houses) and thing got turned to the topic of sex. i ended up explaining to her what occurred when i was younger. this was the first time i've told somebody this. she took this very understandingly and open minded and explained it does not change her feelings for me and we agreed i should go to a clinic. we recently had sex a few days after the conversation, with a condom until i am checked (she is okay with this, and i made sure of it with her at least a thousand times.)  and i don't know if i regret it or not. i really want this to work, we aren't officially together,  what if i have something, even with a condom it could happen. i could have just fucked up her life.

i still want to kill myself.

i put myself in a bad mindset and decided if things dint work out i'll end it

today we went to walmart after work and i guess i was visibly upset on the drive there. when we park she explained that, and that shes worried about me, that the friend who also works with us spoke with her the other day and said that shes worried about us becoming close again, and how she thinks if her and i dont work out shes worried i'm going to end my life. which was my gameplan... i didnt say anything for about a minute, everything just kind of built up in my head all at one and i ended up hysterically crying in front of her. i didnt really explain to her why, i left it at ""i dont know"" which is acceptable for her since she knows the effects of depression.

i care for her deeply, but i still want to die.

i never thought this opportunity would ever happen, and i still want to blow my head off. 

i almost wish this wasnt happening so i could've killed myself without getting this close and end up hurting her even more than she already is.

"might be ending it all tonight.the reason i'm typing this is because i don't really have anybody to reach out to. no one really gives me a sense of resolution that makes me feel ok or have a personal connection/friendship where they reach out to me sometimes. most of them are just moving on with their lives like i wish i was strong enough to do it.

i live in a place where i never really connected. since i was 12 i used english to study and communicate with strangers online. on the long run that resulted on a very lonely childhood and adolescence but i still found a passion that gave me purpose.

today however, i'm afraid its not possible to keep going, i had a trip planned to spain where i would work and study (or maybe just work and end up studying in canada after a year or two.) i was meant to go on this trip a year ago, witch i didn't do so i could finish high school (i'm 18 year's old.) well, the person that was suppose to help me came to visit the people that live with me and talk about my trip. what happened was that such person turned out to be pretty cold and disconnected from me. i also found out about all the documents needed and discovered that even if i managed to get all this shit that can't be made on the small city i live in i would still be there for the small period that i would spend studying. needing to be accepted on a university before all that.

found out that all the money i got was apparently not enough as well. 

yes, i know i could just work here and go anywhere i want in one or two years. problem is that i don't really want to. the immigration process is fucked and i feel zero confidence in myself to do it alone. i also would rather dia than spending the next two years in this hell of a place that keept holding my misery while i remained resilient. i got through three years of this shit and fought to define my individuality and do what i love.

giving up really breaks my fucking heart because i know i could do this and that i have the talent/potential if only i had a good enough opportunity.

my grades in high school are absolutely mediocre and won't lead me anywhere. i have a name i don't recognize and define as me. people i can't connect with. and now no sense of a brighter future or something that can guarantee a better life on the path i was meant to follow.

i've been lonely for an extremely amount of time. i know that not having a guarantee is all part of the future but i really don't have anything or anyone concrete to hold on to.

in spain i would achieve one of my dreams to visit a place i learned about on my studyings. i known could have a better life in the future. but in the present im just tired. tired of fighting and tired of reaching out. i just wanna kill myself and hope for a sense of resolution after that. i know it's horrible and i wish i wouldn't do it but all i can see is repetitive suffering, pessimism and a future i feel i don't even want to live in anymore because of how much it all went wrong.

i'm tired and i'm also a very self destructive person when something goes this bad. i just wish i had a reliable place to at least cry on. 

i'm not completely unaware of the nature of my own sadness. i know i'm young and i know i have a lot of potential that i don't want it to go go waste. it breaks my heart that i will end like this but at the same time is what makes me just do it already.

i'm reaching out to really try to connect to something someone tells me since i don't have anyone.
the only person i had got tired of all my shit and it felt like i was getting in the way of their life.
i'm scared because all i wanted was someone that would help me through all this but i really just don't have anyone. 
my mother is extremely ignorant and manipulative (i actually don't either trust or consider her my mother due to some things that happened.)
my father only shows up 4 times a year to give me an extremely small amount of money.

from where i see it, a great connection is one you create based on who you decided to be. like friends that just stick with you and that reach out to you. the few friends i made never reach out to me at all, they don't really feel the need to talk to me ever.

so i guess that's all, i'm typing this hoping someone could connect with me and offer me a way out (even if i feel so terrible right now that nothing seems likely to change it.)

i'm sitting on my bed right now waiting for people to leave the kitchen so i can grab a knife and hurt myself for good. if i don't die i will probably be institutionalized and then my life will be officially destroyed and wasted if compared to what it could have been.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"barely any emotions, antidepressantsmy psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants for me because i've been having a tough period lately with my family. i'm 14, and i've been staying home a lot from school lately. what i feel in the mornings is that it's easier to stay home, a lot of the times i'm tired, probably because i don't get enough sleep. i can get pretty emotional and i get bad headaches - or migraines. i admit i make a lot of mistakes and don't like gogoing out much. i do martial arts and lost interest in it then stopped going. i have a fear that it could cause more harm than benefits, i've also read that suicide rates in teens are doubled with antidepressants. i haven't ever contemplated suicide, although i have gotten really emotional when i get in an argument with my mom, who starts yelling, to the point where sometimes i close my ears and block her out. i started taking antidepressants yesterday and feel like it's hard to laugh. don't think coffee is the best combination either... i'm grounded for 6 more weeks because of being absent from school. i feel strange, to the point where it scares me, that i've changed ever since yesterday. i look back at the problems we had and they look so little to the point where i wonder if it's necessary. when i read the ibcreased rate of sucide, i won't get it it, right? maybe my psychiatrist should have evaluated me more carefully? perhaps it is hormonal? i feel kind of emotionless. not sad but not happy... placebo effect? my mom says it takes about two weeks so it's all in my head. i hope. i mean, not emotionless like being a psychopath. also, i feel like my memory is a tad worse. part of my left side of my scalp hurts, as if it's inflammed. my counselor told me it's a tension headache. and shit, to add onto all this, i have visual snow syndrome... please reassure me i'm not a victom of antidepressants being handed out like candy. please help, i feel different, in a bad way, kind of like depersonalizaton/derealization., its kind of scary,",suicide,suicide,1.0

my family isn’t terrible, but, they pretty much don’t have a fucking clue on how to handle someone with depression, before i leave, i just wanted to say that i’ll miss my siblings a lot, and my mother as well, as for my father, i will always hate you from the very end, i’ve tried to forgive you multiple times, but you’re just too much of a fucking psychopath, i hope my mother divorces you really soon you manipulative cunt.

"can't seem to jump over the edge...props to anyone that actually reads all of this.


i have been suicidal for about 6 months now, and i've ""tried"" just about every method in the book. i say ""tried"" with quotes because i just can't seem to finish the job.


i find myself pouring countless hours into suicide research. i pick a method and i find ways to not only effectively execute the method, but i also find ways to add my own personal touch. for instance, i am now sitting on my bed and i have cuts all around my neck because i tried to hang myself with a choke collar. like always, i left myself a way out ""just in case,"" and i took it like the coward that i am after hanging there for what seemed like ages.


i don't know why i'm here, and i don't know why i'm posting this. i don't really know a lot i guess, which is why i constantly find myself trying to end my life. i'm extremely confused about the situation i'm in, and i just can't seem to take the stress and the pressure. my life has been turned upside-down over the past few months and i just simply don't want to go further.


i guess i'm just scared of dying. i'm scared that i'll end up in hell, or somehow worse than what i have now. anyone posting that things will ""go black"" or that there is no afterlife can save their time. i have had past involvement in the occult and know first-hand that angels / demons / heaven / hell exist beyond the shadow of a doubt as i have dealt with the first two personally... which logically concludes that the second two exist.


i don't know why i posted this, and i really don't know what i want to hear from you guys. i guess i'm just disappointed. i was absolutely sure that i was ready to go this time. i'm always so sure, but the thought of finally facing what comes next scares me. i've tried everything from the helium hood method to overdosing to hanging to sitting in the garage with the car on, but it always seems to end the same way. i take the bag off of my head, or claw it apart. i run to the bathroom and force myself to throw up pills. i purposefully leave an object that i can use to stand up ""just in case."" i turn off the car and stumble into the house light-headed.


i really just. want. to. go. but i don't have the guts to finally finish myself.


i currently attend a very strict christian college as i thought that it would help me get my life back on track, but it hasn't. as a matter of fact, it has pushed me the opposite direction. i've stayed out of trouble, so i've been promoted to a prominent position here among students. that position being ""prayer leader"" - i know, it's hokey sounding, but they take it very seriously here. i can't go for help now or they'll more than likely kick me out of the college which i can't afford at this point. if they don't kick me out, i will, at least lose my position as pl and they will move me to another dorm room which would move me away from one of the few people in life that care about me. (and yes, the rules state that if anyone loses the pl position he has to move rooms so that he's no longer a part of his prayer group. don't ask, it's crazy around here.)


i. just. want. to. die. ...or do i? i at least know that i definitely don't want to live anymore, and i wish with all of my heart that i could believe what most of you do - that everything just ""goes black."" - it would be so much easier that way...",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm sick of sharpening a nonexistent pencil with a half-hearted handbreaking whatever this is down into terse sentences because otherwise it would be incoherent.

- haven't been diagnosed with anything, but struggled with a melancholic aimlessness ever around the age of seven

- understood that living had no point, but turned it into an excuse not to study and be spoiled

- ten years later: grew up, but it feels like i haven't changed at all and worsened in some aspects

- settled for mediocrity. forgot or ignored some essential life skills (hygiene, grades, social skills and determination) that resulted in bullying and a great decline of my already dismal self-esteem

- ""whatever. keep trudging on. with your inability to do anything right, you'll probably fuck up suicide too.""

- bit by bit, lost interest in previous passions as concentration dithered. have faint dreams or ambitions, but i don't get or complete them because i can't invest myself into anything. losing interest in everything else, even the time sinkers. everything including myself is so vapid and superficial

- be like this until junior year, trying out all those self-help mantras with college on the way (i will ambition without wanting! i will succeed without putting in 100%!), until the cancer nation attacks and takes the only person who (somehow) gave a shit about me: my mother, who raised me alone because my real dad's an abusive asshole. 

- she's one of those people who went to the gym at least four times a week and bought organic vegetables to turn into green juices. she died within the span of a month and spent the last two weeks of her life with little to no brain activity.

- she tried to help me the most, offering lesson after lesson and weekend after weekend just for me, but i fuck that up too and reject her and her love. was afraid she'd find out and become a bigger problem to her than i already was (am), something she didn't deserve with her working to the bone to get where she was.

- spent january wondering how to get my shit together with no one left to provide and how to eat all the food people keep giving

- spent february fucking up harder than january

- likely spending march sinking deeper into the abyss

- it's hard to go to school when feeling like a waste of space and time not just for society, but for the people who pat me on the back or send me ""are u ok"" messages when i fuck up and break down. friends aren't my therapists. can't confide in them without disrupting the harmony. therapy doesn't seem to help either.

- missed too many opportunities to even settle for security

- becoming hyper aware of my faults despite knowing that no one gives a shit and drained whenever talking to people for too long

- at fifteen i vowed that if i still didn't find the point at eighteen, i'd fly to somewhere isolated, drive to a remote area in said area and go with carbon monoxide poisoning. it's still a viable option now

- i'm too much of the wrong things and too little of the good to end up somewhere, let alone anywhere

- externalization used to help. now it doesn't. wake up in the morning feeling too tired to smile and ask other people about their days when small talk comes

- i know i could be experiencing actual problems (human trafficking, my own cancer (like i'm not cancer already), be entrapped in poverty), and that just because life is pointless doesn't mean i can't make the best out of it. i know.  i want to begin each sentence with something other than ""i,"" but life itself is a yoke best delegated to those who can handle the heat. i'm me. i'm a piece of self-aware waste who realizes her insignificance. 

- typing this out because echo chambers are fun when no one knows who you are and will forget

- might go to germany this december and do the deed if i swim into deeper waters of indifference; haven't reached the stage of numbing apathy yet. there are times i'm on the verge.

- meditation may at least help with calming myself down, and the practical guide to suicide is relaxing to read a bit of at night

- sorry for typing too much. oh-oh, brevity, it's working against me

- i hate myself and am indifferent to myself but still utilize humor to cope with the drudgery. yay.

- my mother would be disappointed in me and my overwrought complex(ities) reminiscent of the below-average tumblr poetry blog. hell, even lang leav can do better than the mess above.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"oh where to begin...i've been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth  

this caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family, and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird, out there, bad, ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me. but i just shrugged it off and kept on going.  

then in middle school i started getting bullied, couldn't walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy. then i was homeschooled in 7th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit. but i just kept going.

and then in 8th grade i went back to school, and finally made friends. people still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me. but i actually made friends.

then in high school everything got better at first, i had tons of friends who i considered family. i wasn't being bullied (to my face). and i was actually happy.

then my second year of high school started and boom insomnia. i became extremely irritable, i was sleeping in class, wasn't shaving, dressing like shit and so on. well i didn't know this at the time but my cyclothymia (""lesser"" version of bipolar disorder) had kicked into 12th gear. what makes matters worse is i was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist. so i was getting medication. but can you guess what meds i was getting? just anti-depressants. and for those who don't know, ads + cyclothymia or bipolar disorder = (in my case) hypomania. what fun. basically for 3 years i was mostly hypomanic. i'm sure you can all guess what this was like.  

well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance, this got mistook for narcissism. and a certain (true narcissist) didn't like this. so he went around to all my friends (who i considered family) and told them i was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me. which of course i didn't, i saw almost all of them as my equal.  

and then it gets better, he decided to assume that i was also a liar because i mentioned that i fell into a firepit when i was a kid and melted my hand together. but there's no scar. so i must be lying. even tho it did really happen. i'll find a way to prove it to you if you don't believe me. . he told everyone this. so practically overnight my family was gone.  

my insomnia had gotten to the point where i was staying awake from 81 straight hours and to cope, i turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep. the fallout is obvious.  

so i'm left alone, addicted to xanax, going fucking mad from sleep deprivation, and i dropped out of high school.  

9 months later i had a nervous breakdown, cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder. i start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls. smoking tons of weed to cope. struggling with xanax and ativan. and i have no one. not a single person.

i am a 17 year old guy. long story short, i was born with a birth defect which has caused me a lot of shame, anger, depression, anxiety, etc., really for as long as i can remember. it's not something that other people know about or can tell, but it's something that affects my quality of life. i still need several surgeries, but they are not covered at all by my family's insurance, and i don't know when i would be able to afford them on my own.

anyway, i had an argument with my parents, and that's something that always brings it out. typically, we never fight (maybe once a year, or once every eighteen months) because i stay out of trouble and do good in college. well when we got into this fight, i went into my room to cool off, so i didn't say anything stupid. while i was in my room, i reverted into my one of my worst states, using all my energy to keep suicide off my mind.

even as i'm typing this, i realize how many issues i have. i'm afraid. i've never been able to admit that to myself because i've never been able to talk anonymously. i guess i do need some counselling at the least. i use marijuana irregularly, and its been one of the most helpful things i've ever used in helping fight my depression. so for this reason, i know i can get better. there has to be a way, if drugs can help, i've got to be able to reach that place without them. i just don't know how.

fastforward to summer 2010, and i'm almost homeless...the division shut down 10 months after i'd moved there and no prospects to go back because i had this fucking house i purchased tying me down.  i had to file bankruptcy.  i lost everything.  i went from a job where i was paid reasonably well, was treated with a level of respect to going from shitty job to shitty job, performing poorly and losing more and more confidence in my ability to do my work.  i finally get moved to another division at the previous employer in another city...abandoned the house, filed bankruptcy and now my current employer is unhappy with my performance.  i've been there about 7 months now...things keep changing so much from day to day and i just can't keep up.  i ""can't handle the job"" so my manager says.  my team has been going behind my back and telling him i'm not performing to their expectations.  he's frustrated with me.  i personally don't enjoy the work i'm doing now....it isn't what i was told it would be.  i""m fucking miserable.  i haven't dated in years...i have never been in a real long term meaningful relationship...my family has abandoned me.  what's the fucking point?  i'm rapidly approaching 40...i wasted my college degree to pursue an industry that is causing me nothing but pain and heartache, and i have no direction.

i'm fucking lonely, terrified i'm going to lose my job (this wouldn't be the first time i was either laid off or fired...this has happened about 9 times in my ""career"" now).  i'm a fucking loser and a failure.  i've tried so fucking hard to fit in, to make things work, to prove myself.  i'm exhausted and angry and frustrated with these fucking companies, the politics, my anxiety disorder issues, and my persistent depression.  

i dread getting up in the morning.  i don't even look forward to the weekends because i know it's just a brief stop till we go right back into the hell that is the weekday.  i don't want to be around anyone...i don't work out anymore (i used to go 5x a week).  i'm gaining weight, and have nothing to offer anyone.  i mean, seriously, who would really be interested in someone like me?  fucking. loser.  

i fantasize about throwing myself in front of the train every day i leave from work.  or fantasize about hanging myself in my apartment...even taught myself how to make a proper noose.  i fantasize about downing the entire bottle of clonapin that's supposed to help me through these periods but does not anymore and drifting off. 

people would be upset, yes.  but people would move on.  it wouldnt have an adverse impact on anyone's life...not really.  at most it would be an inconvenience and a ""sad thing"" but what's the point of all this bullshit when all i feel is pain in my heart every single day.  i can't even cry anymore.  i just hate myself so fucking much i want to hurt myself like i did when i was younger....punching mself in the face so hard i can see stars...or banging my head as hard as i could against a concrete wall...or taking my finger nails and dragging them down my face.  why the fuck did my parents conceive me???  this wasn't my choice, so why do i have to finish this life out, knowing for a fact there's nothing else beyond this.  it's better to die than face the fucking rat race every single goddamn day.

suicide worked for my uncle...and my cousin...and my aunt.  when they killed themselves, i felt nothing, except maybe envy that they took the logical way out.  i am nothing on this earth.  i am nothing to anyone.  i'm nothing but a creature that consumes and shits and sleeps and works in a cubicle all day till i go crazy.  and i think i'm finally there.

"why is life helli wish i could tell you when the last time i felt well was. we are speaking mentally and physically. i cannot possibly pinpoint the cause behind these two things which have brought a drastic change to my life. i am an absolute idiot. my anxiety, anger, depression, and numbness has taken me over. my anxiety causes me to be too anxious to eat because i fear being sick. my anxiety caused me to become a shut in. i am not ashamed of becoming a shut in. my anger has caused me to lash out onto loved ones, hurt myself, and almost damage my belongings. my depression just simply holds me back from living like a normal human being. i won’t shower for a week, i won’t get out of bed, i won’t talk to people, and i will constantly be exhausted. my numbness causes somewhat of a mixture of all of these things. it causes me to want to break something because i just want to feel. it makes me yearn to let a few tears out just to reassure myself that i haven’t given up on myself. it makes me anxious because i don’t know if i will randomly have a panic attack. 
physically i am suffering as well. it seems impossible to gain weight. i am constantly feeling as if i will drown in the mucus that is in my throat. when i breathe in, my breath doesn’t even reach near my throat. i catch myself gasping and wheezing for air. there’s not a week that goes by where i don’t feel any sort of pain in my stomach. there’s not a week that goes by where i have a strange bowel movement. there’s not a day that goes by where my throat tickles yet feels as if it is being scratched at the same time which causes me to cough lightly. 
i seem to learn something new everything. they are things that i was supposed to already know. did you know that the 7 in 24/7 stands for how many days there are in a week? there are seven days in a week and i only figured out the meaning behind that 7 in 24/7 a week ago. there are so many things that i should know by now yet i simply don’t. it seems impossible to do basic math. adding, subtracting, multiplying, counting, and measurements are all that i am good at. there is a huge portion that i have always failed, even when i thought i had done phenomenal. 
when there is a loud sound it feels like i can’t hear and my gag reflex feels as if it has been set off. of course, i don’t really gag. i just can feel something in my throat having a spasm when there is a loud sound such as the washer, dryer, or a family member speaking very close to me. my family is loud and does not have an inside voice. 
the only thing that i enjoy doing would be writing. all of my other old hobbies are out of the picture. working out? i haven’t done that in a long time. coloring? i do that sometimes but i can only handle doing it on my ipad. i can’t do it on a literal piece of paper. it makes me upset when the color gets out of the line or when i don’t draw in a straight line. there are many other hobbies which i used to participate in, but i no longer am able to.
i hate it when the light is too bright and flashing lights. i have to close my eyes and sometimes it sends me off into a panic. it makes me want to scream, cry, and throw something at it to make it stop. when there are loud sounds all i want to do is hide. where i am around too many people it makes me want to run and hide. 
a few days ago my doctor ordered a blood test and an ekg. there is no response on the blood test but the ekg was normal. he then proceeded to force me to see a psychiatrist because he assumes that i have an eating disorder. this man does not understand that i truly do love to eat. i am just scared of what the food will do to my body. he poked me and squeezed me and kept telling me how skinny i was. 
i don’t know what is wrong with me but i really want to know. i need to help myself and i need to become normal again. if i don’t become normal again then how will i ever have a family one day? if i were to have children how would i raise them when it’s difficult to take care of myself? who would love somebody who is so screwed up? i just want to be good and healthy again. i wish that i didn’t have to worry about how i was going to feel during the day or night. my life has become pure hell and i don’t know what to do about it.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"it's my birthday...and i can't help but think maybe it'd be fitting to end it here.

nobody has wished me a happy birthday other than my drunk mother, who doesn't actually care about me at all. i'm just a vessel to accept all of her own sadness. anytime i try to talk to her about how i feel, she ends up in a one-up contest, trying to say how much worse she has it than i do. i had a panic attack in public two days ago, but all she could say was, ""you think you have it bad? i didn't put the hamburger in the sink this morning!"" 

none of my friends have said a word to me. they're all talking about their own things. they see me online. they were even playing the same games i was. but they didn't say happy birthday, didn't invite me, nothing. they don't care about me. they say they do, but they never show it. they don't talk to me unless they want something from me. my brother and a group of our other shared friends got together and hung out. i wasn't invited. and when he got home from their get-together, my brother sat and talked about how much fun they had for 30 minutes, never even told me happy birthday.

i'm the type of person that i am ready, minutes before midnight, to be the first one to wish them a happy birthday. because i want their day to start off from second one with happiness and knowing that they're loved and appreciated. i don't even expect the same thing from them, i just didn't expect that they'd go the whole 24 hours ignoring me. even when i openly expressed that i feel so lonely that death seems preferable, that i'm currently looking for a way to do it (i have a specific method in mind), they just keep on talking about how happy they are about their gaming session. 

work is too much. i work so hard, but because i work hard, everyone expects more and more of me. i don't have anything left to give.

things were cool for a while. the texts were certainly were flirtatious. the bullshit started today, when i asked her to hang out. long story fucking short, i found out she has a boyfriend. for like, a week, before we started texting. honestly, thank god i found out. if she’s texting another guy behind her boyfriend’s back, she’ll do it again. i’m not re-entering dating until i leave high school ffs.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"i need advice for a situation with my boyfriend.my boyfriend (we'll call him drew) and i have been dating for almost a year, and we've known each other for two. we are both seniors in college. the entire time i've known him, he's been very hard on himself. his family sometimes makes fun of the weight he gained freshman year. he has also told me that his ex girlfriend used to make fun of his weight and other things. she was very christian, and would make him feel guilty about things like enjoying drinking, enjoying sex, occasionally smoking, not being christian, etc. even now, these issues still sometimes come up. he came very close to attempting suicide once before, several years before we met. every so often, he gets a bit depressed and very low, but never suicidal. last semester, he started applying to grad schools. in the last month or so, he's had a favorable response from one, but not an acceptance yet. of the others, he's been turned down from his first choice and a couple of others, and still hasn't heard back from two or three. i can tell he's stressing about this, but whenever i bring it up, he just shrugs it off. i have noticed an increase in his drinking.

recently, we haven't be able to spend much time together. he's been very busy with school work, as have i. i also just got a new kitten, so i have to stay at my place every night with the stupid cat. last night, my boyfriend's roommate (jason) called me at 2 in the morning to ask if i knew where drew was. jason told me that drew had a really bad nervous breakdown two days ago. last night, he disappeared without his phone, didn't tell anyone where he was going, and jason was very concerned. jason was going to look for him and promised to keep me posted during the search. i immediately jumped in the car to go help. fortunately, on the way there, i got a text from jason saying he had seen drew in one piece heading back to their dorm room, and that if i wanted to head up there he (jason) would give us some space for a bit. i found my boyfriend just sitting on their balcony. i asked him if he was ok, if he wanted to talk about it, if he knew that i was here for him no matter what. all i got in response was short, vague yes's and no's. i asked him if it was about school, and he said yes. i brought him back to stay with me to keep an eye on him. 

today, he's seemed better, but whenever i try to bring up last night or how he's feeling, he gets quiet and doesn't want to discuss it. i chose to respect that, since he's a very introverted person and i know that he'll talk when he wants to. however, while i was at my place and my boyfriend at his, my roommate (rachel) came in to tell me that she had gotten a text from drew, asking her about literary perspectives on suicide (she's an english major, so i guess that's why he went to her). i tried to call him several times, but was sent to voicemail. i texted him, saying that i knew he texted rachel and i really wanted to talk to him. he texted back short, vague answers once again. all i got out of him was that he was ok, he was about to meet with his family, and he'd call me back when he was on campus again. 

right now he's with his family. i'm not sure if he'll actually call me back or not. it depends on how the talk went. i'm waiting a little bit before i try calling again. i'm very concerned about him. i've never seen him in this state before. from comments he's made about his family, i don't really trust their ability to help him feel better. i've told him several times that i'm here for whatever he needs, anytime whatsoever. i've told him that i love him, his family loves him, his roommate obviously cares about him. i don't think any of it is sinking in. i'm not sure what to do at this point. if he's bad, i don't want to back off too much, but i also want to respect his space. i don't know that he's always honest with me about how he's feeling, though. this grad school thing has apparently been bothering him much much more than he's let on. i can't be sure that he's not just acting whenever he seems happier. half of me feels certain that, no matter how bad it gets, he wouldn't do anything. the other half of me knows that i have to take this seriously. i've also been very depressed in the past; i know this isn't something to take lightly.

"boom, headshoti've been thinking about suicide for a long time. the depression started about 5 years ago and was followed by severe anxiety and social paranoia. in the early stages of my depression i reached out to a close friend and told him about the thoughts that were going through my head, how everything felt bland and nothing made me happy anymore but he told me it was just a phase that everybody goes through and it would get better with time, so i waited. 

when the anxiety started, my friends started to notice my behavior and began to ask why i was acting so crazy so i started ignoring their calls and making excuses to be alone so i wouldn't have to answer their questions. the social paranoia came last but not least and it hit like a truck. everywhere i went, it felt like people were watching me and judging everything i did. it was like they were whispering about me behind my back, and it was as if even my friends were out to get me. the weight of those 3 behemoths were too much for me to handle, so i confined myself to my house for about 3 years to dwell in my own self-loathing and disgust. it's been 5 years and i'm still waiting for it to get better, but it only seems to get worse and i'm running out of patience. i know suicide is a selfish act and it will hurt the few people that i have left but i don't want to deal with this anymore. i'll be remembered as a coward who couldn't face his problems but i couldn't care less. 

in the end i've decided on a rather messy ending for myself, but from what i've read it's not very painful and has a high fatality rate. my only concern is what my family will see if they need to identify my body,  i don't want to scar them with that image.",suicide,suicide,1.0

my dad says i am the worst kid in the family as all family members score better than me with the most opportunities. yesterday we got into a fight because my spanish grade dropped from an 85 to a 78 and math dropped from 89 to 80 which rose back up to an 88 but my dad was not happy with that. dad calls me good for nothing worst in the family.

this morning, my 5 year old threw away a christmas present (a science experiment book) that arrived late (yesterday). it's from his uncle. he tossed it because he thought it was boring and didnt like it. i was crushed to see this, because it was a thoughtful gift intended for the family (we 3) to use together.
i told my 5 yo that what he did was wrong. i told him to bring me his 2 favorite stuffed animals. i intended to put them in 'time out' and let him earn them back w good behavior.
he instead brought down his two least favorite stuffed animals to outsmart me.
i then confiscated the 3 stuffed animals in his room, and reminded him that these 3 were his least favorite so he shouldn't care. i threatened to throw them away, like he threw away the book. i haven't, but now i'm stuck.

"my story of depression and anxiety - suicide attemptsi am not entirely sure where to post this except here. here is my story i am 26 years old. i was with someone for 3 years and was planning to propose on our 3rd year anniversary, unfortunately he broke up me before our anniversary date. the aftermath was complete shit, i made every possibly mistake in the book, on what not to do to get an ex back. after 1 month of the bu i made my first suicidal attempt. 4 to 5 months later, which is 3-4 weeks ago (timeline is pretty much a blur for me) i made a second attempt on my life which led me to be hospitalized for several hours under suicide watch. officially today, i started taking anti-depressants. i do not regret trying to take my own life because i created such a horrible car wreck between my ex and myself that i no longer want to live with that guilt. regardless if my intentions were good or not. i still made some bad choices, but i don't think my suicide attempt was one of them. few days till now, i was planning to do another suicide attempt. i have two plans in mind, but i haven't done anything to put it into action. i'm just only thinking about it. each day becomes harder than the next. my ex's last words would forever resonate within me. i visited my ex home unannounced about 4 times. i would send him text that i am coming. then show up in front of his doorstep. during those 4 times he would accept me into his home and we would talk. most of the time, we ended up having sex. which made things incredibly worse for me. after my second attempt in suicide. i tried going over to his house again, he said he will call the police. over the past 3 weeks, i would hear him and his friends youtube/twitch stream talk about me. not very positively. i can avoid watching or hearing whatever him and his friends are saying. the point is i left such a negative mark on someone i cared about the most. i feel guilty, ashamed, not worthy of much. his friends tell me, he just wants to move on, us go our separate ways, but one thing that will always carry me is his last words to me. i will never be able to forget that. that is what is still pushing me to think of suicide. that feeling of being seen as a bad guy. being seen as a crazy ex gf. hurts me incredibly. my ex isn't a bad person. however, speaking to his friends about my side of the story makes me feel like i am. i am no longer speaking to his friends. however, my ex's words and his friends words are still in my heart and in my mind. i still want to end my life. ending my life means no more responsibilities, no more anxiety, no more overthinking, no more heartache, and i no longer have to carry this horrible memory of what i have done to push my ex so far. i just want the pain to end. i just want to forget. i want unhear what he said about me, i want to be left alone. i deserve happiness, yet it has not arrived to my doorstep. i just want everything to standstill for just a moment so i can scream and cry. have no one judge me for crying and feeling the way i feel. i feel so utterly lost, hurt and misunderstood. my whole being right then and there died with me on my first attempt. i no longer remember who i was before. please help, i am seeing a psychiatrist and therapist. i began taking my anti-meds today. i just feel so lost and hurt. i feel ashamed of my actions after the break up. if i didn't push my ex so hard and seemed so desperate, i probably would be talking to him today.",suicide,suicide,1.0

my only regret is that i’ll miss that new tool album on august 30th. been waiting a long time. i almost made it.  but destiny calls. we should try to help each other more.  or maybe not. i have no one who knows me who will notice my death. isolated. lonely. full of regret. depression. gad. sad. bpd. fear, sadness and anger. no. way. to. live. this is for the best. but if you still have people that care, keep going.  you never know.  i, unfortunately, unquestionably, do not. there are worse things than death.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"cheated onhi there, a little background information on me: my name is alex, i turned 24 last month and i broke things off with my ex (23) last weekend. we've dated for two years and have been on and off for the longest time. she has borderline personality disorder and i have my own issues with abandonment growing up. when we first met, we hooked up rather quickly and it was a huge red flag for both my mother and i, but being as i had never had a girlfriend before, i ignored them and pursued a relationship with her. throughout the course of our relationship, she kept a lot of male attention and claimed they were only friends when in reality she was either cheating or making money as an escort online. she'd cheat, i'd find out, we'd break up, we'd miss each other, we'd get back together, and on and on... it eventually started to take a toll on me and i attempted to take my life because i felt like i wasn't worth anything anymore. all the abandonment issues i had been running from in my childhood started to surface and i couldn't handle the overwhelming feeling that i wasn't good enough for anyone to love. long story short i ended up 5150'd and on release i found my phone flooded with sobbing messages of regret from my ex. it's so hard hearing the voice of someone you love saying how much they miss you and love you and regret everything they've done and apologize like they've never done before, but looking back i know i fell in love with someone who doesn't exist all the time. we were together for a few months before she started doing the same thing again and i ended things off. i spent a while alone trying to date around and ended up meeting someone else who on paper seemed like the ideal girlfriend: no mental problems, had a job, had a car, had her own place--everything my girlfriend lacked. the only problem was that i wasn't physically attracted to her. i broke things off with her after two months because i realized it wasn't fair to waste her time if i wasn't falling in love like i had with my ex. a month later, my mother and stepdad were planning a thanksgiving dinner at the local country clubhouse where my ex worked (i had assumed due to her borderline personality disorder and work history that she wouldn't have held down this job) and offered to buy me a seat so i agreed. she ended up still working there and the entire time she was really pleasant and nice to my parents while i tried being an asshole and just ignored her attempts to strike a conversation. at the end of the dinner when we were about to leave, she asked my parents for a hug and they agreed. the whole time, they were falling for her shit and i really hated it so i just walked off to the car alone. when i got home i messaged her back telling her to eff off should we ever run into her again and that i didn't appreciate the little show she put on. she defended her self and said that during our break up (it had been 8 months or so since we last talked) that she had done some growing up, she had kept her job, and had really been ashamed of everything. we talked for a long time and we eventually got back together. we were together since nov and it ended last weekend when i caught her talking to other guys who openly flirted with her despite her mentioning me. (i don't know to what extent this flirting went to because she deleted the history prior to the day we broke up, but the day we did, they had flirted and he seemed to have been giving good morning texts so...) either way, right now i feel a bit hopeless. i feel worthless and lost right now. i don't know where i'm going or what my purpose is, but i can't help but feel like i'm at fault. was the sex bad? was i not giving enough attention? am i ugly? poor? short? what's so wrong with me to deserve this? i don't know what to do, i just want to run away from this pit of despair in my gut. i just want to go home and have a beer and cry all this crap out because i have too much to live for. i can't go back to wanting to end myself but at the same time i want to move forward, i just need someone to talk to as i don't have friends.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i want to die, but at the same time i'm too scared to do anything. i'm terrified that if i try to kill myself and it doesn't work out, that i'll have to face the consequences of it. i've kept my depression a secret from the majority of people, and if i failed and ended up in hospital they would all find out. i don't know what the fuck to do.

but now i dont feel so forced to be this way, because i can be dead. im scared of death, i feel like we all are. becoming nothing is a hard thought to accept, but living has become even more terrifying, and it takes more strength to live than it does to die, strength that i feel like i've run out of. ive noticed it does feel different going about my life with the gun under my bed. its almost easier getting out of bed now and doing small things knowing that i am not forced to endure the same pain tomorrow, making every effort feel pointless. the next time i am feeling this unreal pain, or nothing at all, ill go out into the woods, and put a bullet into my brain.

"should i kill myself ?sup, i ended up here because i hate myself so much i try to find reasons to hate me more and.. well whatever.

since i’m an attention seeker i’l gonna tell my life and brag for shit i don’t deserve.

i’m 18 and i feel like i’m not growing up, but getting older. my life has been more like a slowly faillure in all it’s way (exonomics, cultural) i don’t like the way i’ve been educated, neither the place, the peoples, whatssoever i hate everything i’ve made. most of peoples says i’m cool and nice but the few peoples i got very close to just ended up hating me. why ? i don’t know peoples like me don’t deserve explanations.
i’m bad at school i don’t know what to do i have litterally no friends, i personally investigated on myself and found that i was bipolar, depressive and had kinds of social anxiety (yeah i’m 18 but do diagnostics wtf, whatever.).

i hate myself so much, if anyone comes to like/love me i wouldn’t like/love this person anymore because this persons like something that i hate. i want the best in my life and surely not someone who like stuff like me.

the sad thing is that i always knew i was a terrible asshole even tho the closest peoples sweared to me i wasn’t, ended up they all gave up on me.

i won’r never be able to achieve my life as i know i’am a complete mental disordered since im young (i feel the same idiot and ignorant as i was when i was 5), the only things i loved finally hates me and everything i love feels like it not for me.

my passions even feels to high for me, if they were humans they would spit on me and ell me to like something less intresting.
i even feel like a rapist (even tho i never raped anyone) but i have the same feeling, i used peoples and forbed them to be free and now i’am that asshole who is sad. (even if i never forbid nothing to anyone but still, let’s not be cool on me i’am a bad person so that’s it, peoples already told me i was too bad for them after them saying so beautiful things about me, and sincerly..)

i know i’am a stupid ass cunt because the most intresting, inteligent and succesfull peoples i know, who loved me before now hates me because i’am.. me.

i’am really considering to kill myself, waiting to fail my studies or my life to it. 

by the way i can’t make friends because i’am too honest, and no one wanna be friend with a depressive cunt like me, and if they do sadly they enjoy being with a depressive cunt, so i won’t like them anymore.. 

i don’t want everyone to be my friend or close peoples i know, lnly beautiful and succesful peoples.

i’m bad you know, i don’t even write something that makes sense.

please if you can just insult me or whatever you can to make the hate around me live, except me now no ones hate me (because i can’t talk with peoples who does, apparently they will sue me for harrassement)
i’am annharraser anyway itls what they think.

i’am a fucking asshole.

you really might now be wondering wtf you just read, k’m not native in english sorry i speak worse than a 4years old child.

why can’t i be normal, and normal peoples do exist don’t tryna make me eat this lie, they do and they live, maybe if you’re reading this it’s because you are just not normal like me somewhere and peoples like us don’t deserve to feel normal, and if they do it’s an illusion.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm not even sure if i want to die, i just feel like such a profound failure and burden to the worldjust found out another old friend blocked me on social media. i literally have no friends anymore. a while ago i was dreaming about going to university but now - what's the point? 

i can't concentrate on anything. i can't see myself studying, working, doing anything useful in life. i'm completely useless, not contributing to anything in society. and when i say that i mean it. i'm a week away from my finals - still haven't studied. no chance of passing or going to uni. can't get a job. can't lose weight, can't make friends, can't even stop yelling at my family about useless shit and being a burden. no matter what all the people around me have ended up hurt somehow, to the point that they've had to cut me out of their lives. i don't want to keep hurting people. 

i can't help but think: if someone's so profoundly useless, with no potential whatsoever of becoming a functional part of society, why should they keep living? the only thing that keeps me from attempting is pure fear. i fear death immensely, i would probably never seriously attempt anything. but i do think about it, a lot.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i dont know what to dohihi!! ive posted on reddit before but never with anything this serious. i made a throwaway to talk abt this cuz i dont want it getting linked back to me. 

recently ive felt more suicidal than i have my entire life. i started to self harm again very recently, and im scared its going to get worse. 70% of me wants me dead and the last 30% doesnt. im a 20 y/o trans man living with his 19 y/o boyfriend and his mom. he's the most supportive, kind boyfriend ever and he's already helped me a lot.

the thing is, i cant be left alone. every time i am left alone i begin to want to (and end up actually) self harming. my bf doesnt work so hes home with me when im not at work, but he sleeps different hours and can't be with me all the time. my depression has gotten to the point where im having a really hard time taking care of myself. i cant prepare meals, and when i do i nearly puke them up. i have a hard time showering (i managed today but it might be almost a week before i can get myself to do it again) im really scared im going to become flakey at my job. i just started my job a few weeks ago and im really enjoying it so far. i care to keep it, but im scared my depression and especially my anxiety will get in the way of me going in. ive already noticed my anxiety flares up really bad at times when i go in.

im not actively on any antidepressants, but i am on adderall for my adhd. i just ran out yesterday and i need to wait a few days for another prescription. sometimes it does help with my depression, since it gives me a way to distract myself by hyperfocusing on video games. its not perfect, though, and can make me a cranky bitch. in turn, makes my anxiety flare up. im also going to get a refill for the antidepressants i was already on before. i didnt notice a difference in my moods when i took them last time, but i wasnt at such a low point before. i've also used thc edibles to cope, but since im under 21 i cant exactly go out and get some. i dont know when ill have some again.

basically, i don't know if i should check myself into a hospital or not. as i said, my bf is here to help me take care of myself... but its not really fair to him. im his boyfriend, not his child. hes willing to look out for me, but he also has a life to live.

ive mentioned the idea of going to one yesterday, and he basically told me its all up to me. my main worries are insurance, my work, and the fact that i'm trans. i know that i'll most likely be housed separately because im trans (which tbh im ok with), but i also have to give my deadname at the start since my insurance hasnt been updated yet. that scares the fuck out of me because if im misgendered while im there, i wont get any better. i pass as male (ive been on t for almost a year) but because of my deadname, it might be confusing.

i'm also really scared about my work. i'm not too worried about keeping my job. my management is really understanding and if i tell them it's life or death, they'll let me off the hook. i feel i can trust them knowing i have depression, so long as they dont tell everyone else i work with. one of my biggest concerns is with money. i dont get paid a lot, so my first paycheck is already gone to bills and food (hell, im in the negatives rn). i get paid again next week, but if i go to a hospital and miss a few days of work i might not get that much for my next paycheck. this ties in with my insurance worries. i dont have the best insurance, and im scared that they wont cover it or will only partially cover it. i really, really dont want to borrow money from anyone and im scared i'll be in debt or be turned away because i can't pay for it. 

not only that, but i've also heard being at a mental hospital is hell. my brother and my bf have both been in one for a few days and they hated it. i dont know if it actually helped them, but their situations were different from mine. im scared of the other people there, since i really dont want to be around other mentally ill people. i have really bad social anxiety and i would hate to have to talk to people who arent professionals trying to help.

tldr ;; im feeling suicidal and im self harming. i dont want this to get worse. i dont actually want to die, but im scared i will. i need to figure out if i should go to a hospital or not because i simply can't trust myself.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i didnt try to pry. i didnt really try to stop her. i just kept reassuring her that i was there, no matter what help she needed. words like these across the internet dont have much weight but i... idk.   


she didnt let me listen to her last track. said that i could only listen  to it if it did get released on one of the big labels she'd submitted it to (dubstepgutter, ukf, monstercat etc.) i told her very honestly and as gently as i could that her music was nowhere near the standards of those labels, plus she needed experience, branding, management etc.  


she didnt have any of it. she told me she deleted it and she was ""going away.""

"i doubt anyone will read this but i just need someone to vent toi feel like my entire life has come crashing down. i have anxiety, depression and autism and both my anxiety and autism work together to prevent me from being able to communicate with people so i'm extremely isolated and have lost all my friends as they have all just given up on me at this point. the only friend i have is a guy that i am intensely in love with and have been for a long time, but he has already rejected me a long time ago and has recently got a new girlfriend. i feel like i can't live without this guy, my life is pointless and not worth living without him, it hurts knowing that i would give up my entire life for him and he barely gives me a second thought, it makes me feel worthless and like i'm simply not good enough, i want to spend every minute of my life with him but he's not interested in seeing me at all and only does every so often because he feels bad for me. when i do get to spend time with him, i want every day of my life to be like that but he has other plans with another girl. i cry about him every day because it hurts so much and just feels like i'm being stabbed in the heart over and over again. he's the only reason why i'm even alive right now, but not only does he not need me, he doesn't even want me. in general, i feel like i'm the worst person in the world. i'm ugly, have the worst personality under the sun and that's been confirmed because every friend i've ever had has given up on me. i'm a massive burden to everyone and just so boring and stupid and immature and pathetic and worthless. i seriously can't do a single thing right. i think i'm gonna be alone forever. i cut myself pretty often and since i'm 15 years old right now i still live with my parents and they've caught me doing this before and they just try to make me feel bad about it and put more weight on my shoulders and it hurts that they don't even care to understand. furthermore, i feel so weak and empty and alone, and also trapped, i feel basically trapped in my own skin and i just want to be happy one final time but all my happiness has slipped away and i just miss the times where i didn't have violent mood swings every day and spend every night crying. i feel constantly like i'm about to explode but my social anxiety always stops me from being able to express myself to people. i'm the only person in the world that i have and even i hate myself. as a child i dealt with a lot of bullying and physical abuse and there was a point where i was practically famous in my town because every time i would leave the house i would always have people in large groups of around 20 harass me and yell abuse at me. i didn't even know these people, but everyone seemed to know me. i would be scared to leave the house and every time i came across someone i would be scared that they were going to abuse me because i didn't know who was in on it and who wasn't and it seemed like everyone was against me. i remember one of them saying that he was trying to make me break and in the end kill myself. this has still got me terrified of other people and i feel like everybody is trying to kill me by default and i feel like i just can't associate with other people and even when i try it always goes wrong, but being isolated makes me extremely depressed and i've been alone for so long that it's driving me fucking insane. i don't know what to do anymore, i've left so much shit out and i might do another post on that but i feel like words just can't express how i'm feeling at the moment, everything just fucking sucks",suicide,suicide,1.0
"not sure where to go from herei've been struggling to get this down for a while. every time i start it, i get to the end, read it over, then delete it without posting. i'm just going to type it out this time and post it without rereading it, so sorry if something in here doesn't make sense.

i have been out of college for going on two years. since then all of my friends have scattered across the country. i ended up around philly about a year ago, after commuting from my parents house for almost a year. i work with people who, apart from 4 others, are all at least 15 years older than myself, so the 4 of us who are younger have a hard time finding things in common with the older ones, and they look down on us as if we're trying to steal their jobs. the 4 of us only really get along in a work manner as well.

because of these things i know pretty much no one, and i very rarely get to talk to my old friends. i'm not that great at meeting new people. sure, i meet people, but it never goes anywhere. i've never really been the person people randomly call to hang out in general. it also doesn't help that philadelphians are pretty damn unfriendly. another problem has to do with me being gay. i can not seem to meet gay guys who don't want to try to hook up. 95% of the time, if i do meet a gay guy he vanishes as soon as he figures out i'm not going to be hooking up with him. this is not limited to ones i've met on grindr, scruff or any of those other apps or websites. i am not a flamboyant gay and most people don't even know until i tell them, so meeting gays in real life is also very difficult.

on top of being cripplingly lonely, my job is kinda terrible. i was hired to be a designer, but all i end up doing is editing power points. completely mindless work and puts my 4 years of college to fucking shame. it's easy to say ""well go find a new job!"" but it's not that easy to do. i have produced really nothing to show an interviewer. i'm still stuck with my college work. what kind of interviewer would want to see college work after someone has been in the field for 2 years? also, my place of work pays higher than really anyone else in the area, so moving to a new job could be difficult financially.

now onto the dating side of my life! this stuff does intertwine with my friendships too. i have been single for over two years. my last relationship lasted 2 years and ended when i found out he was letting some other guy pay him to be allowed to suck his dick. this is not the first boyfriend who has cheated on me. i really don't think i've had a relationship end well. i've been on several dates over the past two years. the 3 guys i got along with the best had to move for various reasons very early on. one to ca for grad school, the other two to pittsburgh for work. the other dates have been your general bad dates. people whose photos were 60lbs ago, shit personalities, etc.

from september to february, thats five months, i was under the impression that i was dating someone. turns out, not so much. he wasn't under the same impression. that hurt a lot.

i also finally got to go on a date with a guy i've quietly had a crush on for a little while and he has liked me for a while as well. i met him because he works at a place i'd go for lunch when i work sometimes. it went really well - until the end. i said something sarcastically and he took it very wrong. today i got a message from him: ""please don't text or call me again, thanks"".

so, here i am after that, sad as usual. normally, i'd just be upset for a little and move on. but it's getting harder and harder to do. since college, and especially since moving here, i've been getting more and more bitter towards life, love, everything. i've been getting more and more depressed and secluded. i don't know how much longer i can take this. it's just one blow after another. it feels like i'm going insane.

edit: i'm also adding this. i am out with being gay. people know, i don't bring it up unless there's a reason really, but i don't hide it. where i work while a lot of people are fine with it, there are a few who make a lot of comments. i'm not sure if they don't know i'm gay or what. my creative director is one of the worse. he's very homophobic and makes a lot of comments about how it's wrong. never in my direction, but he says it around the office. he also makes a lot of gay jokes and often talks with a lisp on purpose around some of the employees in a joking way (but i do find it offensive at times). he's not always around me, but when he is he tends to make my job very very stressful.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm going to do it...i have often times contemplated suicide. i suffer from depression and find a lot of things hard to deal with. obviously i've never gone through with it, i'm not some kind of computer ghost. i think it stems a lot from my years in middle school. it was right after my parents had gotten divorced, my dog had died, and i gained enough weight from emotional eating to be considered ""clinically obese,"" something that the doctor decided to withhold from me for a few years, for some reason. i got bullied a lot in this time and felt a real sense of distance between myself, my friends, and my family. kind of like i was alone in the world. i'm doing a lot better now. i lost pretty much all of the weight, learned better social skills, and have gone on to be a mostly happy person. in a lot of ways, that struggle really did help me become a better person. it helped me really develop a sense of humor, since i had to learn to laugh at a lot of shit. it helped me grow a thicker skin, since i had to learn to deal with other peoples' bullshit. i'm ready to go...",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i just want to fall out of existence and have nobody be sad about it. that's about it really. see, before my birth, nobody asked me if i wanted a life. this is because of the obvious practical implications. at the point in my life where it can be said that i was first able to consider my existence properly, it was already too late. i have already become tangled in a net of people who care. their purest wishes, for which i cannot fault them, coerce me into a life that i do not want. for if they were to stop caring, and if i could put myself where nobody would have the distress of discovering my body, i would not even hesitate.

and there is anger, because i do not want a life. i do not want to put in the effort that it would take to process myself through therapy and become a functional human being. i am not saying that it is impossible for me to be happy. i feel that if i were to co operate with such entities, and have us work together to fix myself, i would likely become happy and productive. what i am actually saying is that i do not want it. i do not want to improve myself, nor do i want to cause distress. given that i am not willing to compromise on my wishes, there can be no movement in this. i am angry like a trapped beast, because that is what i am. so i am angry only at myself. my pitiful, weak, ridiculous self. maybe that is the cruellest trick fate has dealt me. the weakness, neither to improve myself nor to end myself. simply to be here as a...

...complete ass.

but those handful of people who i have spoken to seem to think that the medical profession has some answer. they seem to think that, if i went to a doctor, they would change my mind. no, i'd have to co operate, i'd have to want to change, and i do not. all i want is something that is impossible. all i want is to fall out of existence and have nobody be sad about it.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i don't know how to stop fucking things upi've been depressed for a long time. in high school i had no friends due to my extreme social anxiety. i shut everyone out and hardly ever talked. by the time i graduated last october, i was really tired of life. i met a guy on tinder, and after a few weeks of knowing him i decided to do a dumb ass thing and run with him.

on day two of the road trip i rolled my car on a gravel road. we were both uninjured but the car was totalled. instead of going home, i decided to buy us both a plane ticket to a city we wanted to visit on the other side of the country. we stayed for a month and used up all of my savings before we finally had to come home. i fell in love with this guy - how calm he was through everything that happened, how he always made me feel better and put a smile on my face. 

since we've gotten back, things have just gotten worse and worse for me. i smashed the screen of my laptop and can't afford a new one. i started smoking weed more and more. i housesat for a family friend, who i managed to piss off my letting my boyfriend's friends be too loud late at night so the neighbours complained. i fucked up and lost my $15000 university scholarship by enrolling in the wrong units, forcing me to drop out. i barely see my parents because i can't face them. i can't find work and my boyfriend is unemployed too. i can't tell if it's good for me to be with him or if i'm just to scared to be alone again.

everything is just too overwhelming. i want to get away from it all. i've tried taking it one step at a time but i can't find a job and that's the one thing i really need. i'm so tired of trying but still managing to make so many mistakes.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i just want to talk about my progress the past 8 months so i have never been the most healthy person mentally, physically, or “spiritually”

but this school year i have decided to make changes in the way i live and it’s affected me drastically. first off i started eating healthy meals and eating 3 times a day. (normally i would eat 1-2 meals and it be extremely unhealthy) next i started going to sleep at healthy times and meditate before i go to sleep and when i wake up to make sure my mind was in the right place every day. once i was at a healthy weight and in the right mindset i started running 1-2 miles every day just to get back into shape before i started sports. after 3 weeks of this i started football, and mind you i go to a small school where we play 6 man football and we aren’t very good at it either but we still try. so it’s my first year at this school and i try to make a splash in athletics and i actually succeed in that area by being defender of the year. at this point a lot of people know who i am, but now really in a good way because i may be good at football but i am a bit of a weird person. so everyone knows who i am but not a lot of them want to be my friend. but fortunately i have found a small group of friends i belong with and for the first time in 2 years i feel like i belong with a group of people and they love me for me. in the last month my teachers put me in academic contests just to see how i would do, and for the first time doing it i’m advancing in every event i competed in(which is 3) and hopefully i can go to state for this but that’s being extremely hopeful. and last week i set a school record for highest level press of 1 rep which was 500 pounds.

"just some rants...i would not say that i currently am suicidal, though the thoughts linger, that is something that i'll admit. i have attempted to strangle myself twice already, but i had reassured myself that things would get better before it. but right now, i'm at my wits end, things are going sour everywhere, and i just feel helpless and alone; in a way, like many people in this subreddit.

i'll post some details. my main issue comes from my ""friends."" these are people i would hang out with, and yet there's no connections, nothing realistic to bind us together. i always feel like the odd man out; rather i know. i was gone for a week and nobody noticed, except for a few individuals. in honesty all i want is one friend that i can rely on no matter what; just one real friend that would always be there for me, and yet here i am, alone. it always bothers me how i'll always ask how their day was on steam or text them if they need anything, and nobody will say anything to me. i'll be on steam all day, and not a single damn message. not a single one. i have to be the guy that messages people, i'm the guy that listens to their shit, i'm the guy always their, and when its my turn to get help, their backs are turned, they're ""busy"", they're this and that and this and that and this and that. i just don't find it that fair. 

and yet at the same time, i've been fighting with the idea that life truly is meaningless. it just seems that we're always striving for something better, a better job, etc, and yet there isn't really a point. in the end, we're all going to die, our endeavors forgotten, and our names to be lost in the wind. it just doesn't seem fair for me to go out and get shit on, only to get nothing in the end. 

i don't know, i just needed to rant, though those are just the big issues. i might be a bit scatter brained right now, but thanks in advance. love you guys for your awesome work, and i can only float on right? but basically i'm asking myself, why shouldn't i just point the gun in my head and end it now?",suicide,suicide,1.0

""life after high school is better, this will all go away"". like the idiot i was, i believed them and chose to go on living for another 9 years.

well, i'm tired of waiting for life to get better, even when i try. i waited for this amazing life that lay ahead of me, and now that it's here, it sucks even more than when i was a teenager. well, fuck it, i'm not this young kid with a ""bright future"" ahead of me, i'm a grown man with a shitty present. i've outgrown all of the fun social activities i was supposed to have over the past 9 years, all of my acquaintances are getting married, buying houses etc.. and i'm still here, with absolutely shit all. 

unless somebody can magically give me a reason why i should bother to slog through middle and old age, where i'll just get older, uglier and unhealthier, until i die alone in some nursing home somewhere, i'm done. i've tried and tried, but this life i apparently had before me has turned out to be a huge sham.

edit: i should clarify, i have a job, but it's an awful one. and i've quite 3 jobs before that, and they just keep getting worse. i have tried to make my life better, i've moved to a different city, i've tried therapy, i've tried pills, i've tried going out to clubs and meeting people, but in the end, i still end up in the same awful place. i appreciate all the answers, but i still see no reason to live past my twenties. i've already wasted my youth, and i'll waste my old age too, so checking out early seems to be the best solution right now.",suicide,suicide,1.0

my family life is toxic, and there's no love between me and my parents, or me and my siblings.  my weight has ballooned because i've been overeating to cope with all these negative feelings.  i'm in a program to get a masters of accounting, but i won't be done and able to get a job for 2 years.  until then, i can't afford to move out (i live in an area where rent and cost of living  is too high to work a minimum wage job). i feel so hopeless and out of options.  i found myself looking up ways to kill myself without even thinking about it today.  my boyfriend knows i've been suicidal before, but pretends i've never right it up.  i have no support, no job, no money, and no friends who live in my area anymore.  i was always such a smart kid, went to a good college, got good grades, but i'm such an impotent failure these days.  i'm scared of what i'm going to do if i can't keep going through the motions for 2 years before i can leave my family for good.  i'm scared of what it means to be with a partner who can't or doesn't want to deal with my mental health problems.  i wake up sad in the morning, because i wish that is never had to stop sleeping and dreaming.  i'm such a cliche, but i just don't know how to cope with this anymore.  it's like depression is an ocean and i'm standing in one place.  i can handle the low tide and i think it's gone away, but the high tide comes and i can't do anything to save myself.  i don't know if i have the courage to actually kill myself, but it's so scary to feel the desire to do it again.

edit:  i just got into another fight with my parents.. i can't  do this anymore",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i want to die.i'm having a bit of a anxiety attack so i thought id express myself here.

i'm 23 years old, struggled with depression off and on. i've always had it, it's just sometimes it's at the back of my mind, supressed. right now i'm really feeling it. 

i'm going to mention i've had numerous paranormal experiences throughout my life.. this will be relevant later.. just recently, me and my girlfriend witnessed to what we described as a black shadow cloud.. looked a bit like the smoke thing from the television show lost. i made a thread about it, you can check it out. i'm bringing this up because i now know that there is more to life than we know. i'm pretty sure there's a 4th dimension from which beings come from and observe us. i now know there is intelligent life which we know nothing about. indeed alien. i say this because i witnessed i with someone else seeing the same exact thing. i have seen other things by myself including a 3x3ft red/orange orb of radiating light just a few feet from me... that was when i was about 13. my girlfriend described seeing the same orb just a few years ago. i never told her about the experience until then. she has also never witnessed anying until she has been with me. she has also been chased by a large white orb that descended from the sky. i don't care if you don't believe in these experiences. i'm just sharing because it's relevant.  

anyways i bring this up because it's really hard for me to sleep at night knowing i'm probaby being watched by something unknowingly capable of who knows what. also as a kid, i had a poltergeist experience that comprised of the t.v turning off, light switch flipping down, and bedroom door shutting and locking. nobody else was there except my elderly grandma making food in the kitchen. i still have a lot of stress and anxiety over it.. i always have to prop something against the door. shitty thing is few people believe me. i don't really care anymore anyways.

 just about everynight before i sleep, i pray to these things, or anything intelligent that can understand me, to end my life while i sleep. whether you believe my experience or not, the point i'm getting at is that i'm getting desperate to die. i meditate and call out for any intelligent life form to take me away, or kill me in my sleep. it would just be so relieving, so nice and easy for something to just kill me in my sleep. it's just a soothing meditation of knowing there's a possibility i could just die in my sleep. 

knowing that there is a dimension of higher life gives me hope. hope that when i die there will be a chance of a better existence. it gives me motivation to end this pathetic life. whats shitty is that when i tell people they just basically say im crazy or some shit. like ok fucktard two people dont hallucinate the same fucking thing. i don't have mental illnesses besides from depression. i dont hallucinate. i dont hear voices. im not crazy.. what sucks is that these experiences just further alienate me.  i feel like i have ptsd from them and nobody takes it seriously. i have only had about 6 experiences in my life.... they arent schizo hallucinations... but the experiences do bring comfort knowing that these things, whatever they may be could possibly answer my wish of wanting to die... sorry if i'm repeating myself or rambling.

i hate life. i hate people. i hate being awake. i'm tired of life, i'm drained. i just feel done, i want to just get it over with. i've started fantasizing about killing myself. i'll put a loaded gun to my head sometimes. i'll put a razor sharp knife to my huge veins in my arm. i'll think about setting up a mask with nitrogen. just lots of suicidal thoughts.

i hate my life. i think if i could not be around people, not work, and be able to mind my own business that i would be okay with living. i really hate working.. i literally start having anxiety attacks thinking of work. i think it's the main thing causing my depression. i absolutely hate it. while i'm smiling telling people goodmorning and that i'm fine, i'm thinking about kiling myself and begging to die. 

like previously mentioned, i don't like people. i have reasons for not liking other people. people are simply a liability. it's a use or be used world. under certain circumstances, people will have a negative effect.. that negative effect could be anywhere on the spectrum of being minimal or extreme. just a liability.. other people do what they want, even if its doing good just so they can get something in return. people don't realize, but all relationships give and take, you're all being used and you're also getting something out of it. this is at it's best. most people are simply parasitic to others. most people are just fucking evil. yeah, i've seen firsthand how evil people can be.

 the world is a fucked place. so much pain, suffering, misery. happiness seems to just be a temporary escape from it all. i literally feel like this place is some kind of hell. maybe i fucked up somewhere before this life. maybe we all fucked up. fucked up to the point that we literally had to crawl as worms and make our way to being what we are now. it's an endless process of misery and pain.

i'm eventually going to die anyways. we all will die at some point. even if the answer to immortality is available or will be, it will be kept away from the majority. we build our image up, we form these petty relationships, just to lose all of these attatchments in the end. 

i've felt pain. physical and mental. we all have. knowing that the worst pain i've experienced is probably nothing compared to the infinite array of curses that can plauge us in our lives, is really hard to accept. knowing down the line, i will slowly lose all i have known, meanwhile knowing that i will be experiencing my draw of pain, is a hard pill to swallow.

i'm just having an anxiety attack right now. thought maybe giving a brief summary into my world would help. i'm not really looking for advice.. i dont want to hear things like, it gets better, dont do it, etc... just wanting to express my pain. 

i just smoked some weed just now.. the anxiety was just hitting me too hard. i was freaking out. what sucks is i know that when i smoke weed, it makes my depression worse or a few days after. so i have that to look forward too. i havent touched weed in over a year. i hate having to rely on things. oh well. 

you just dont know how badly i want to die... i just need more courage to do it myself. i feel like i just dont belong here anymore. really the only thing stopping me is my fear and i'm trying to overcome it. i'm in a lot of mental pain. suicide feels like the only answer right now.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"stucki'm stuck

there was a point in my life where i really wanted to die. 

now, i can't. 

&amp;#x200b;

i feel like i live a relatively privileged life. my family is kind, i have good friends, i go to a privileged school. i get to do and see things that many don't see in a lifetime. the world around me is beautiful. but i don't feel worthy of it.

&amp;#x200b;

i started feeling like i wanted to die. no idea why. i'm not clinically depressed. i have no mental illnesses that i know of. i just hated my soul. not myself. i hated the being i had created. i was in pain. i am a very appreciative person. and that has become my downfall. i appreciate the world around me so much that i have diminished myself as a human being. i love everything. and i hate it.

&amp;#x200b;

i wanted to die.

&amp;#x200b;

this feeling continued for a long time. but now i have reached a point where i realized that i am not worthy of feeling sad. that i am not allowed to feel the satisfaction of feeling suicidal. because i am privileged and i am supposed to be happy. 

&amp;#x200b;

i feel sad, then i feel angry, then i feel depressed, then i feel suicidal, then i feel mad at myself for being suicidal, and then i want to die all over again.

&amp;#x200b;

i know that if i were to kill myself, i would cause so much pain to all the people around me. they would think i was selfish to do that. do i really exist just to please other people? am i just sticking around so that other people don't have to suffer?

&amp;#x200b;

i don't want to die.

&amp;#x200b;

because then other people will get hurt.

&amp;#x200b;

i go up to my room and cry my eyes out for fun. then i sit, forcing myself to smile in the dark. because i'm not supposed to be sad. i'm too privileged to feel sad. 

&amp;#x200b;

i wish i was never born. then i could just not exist and nobody would feel the pain of me leaving. because i was never there in the first place. but now i'm stuck here. i only matter when i want to leave. otherwise, i'm meaningless. but perhaps i shouldn't pity myself. after all, that would be awfully selfish of me.

yeah. i should just forget about it and move on. me and my mom had a whole arguement about this. i shouldn't be projecting my negative feelings onto her. but i just couldn't fucking stand. something about this just fucked me up.

my aunt and uncle knew this piece of shit molested me. sexually abused me. i was sexually abuse at ten. i was ten fucking years old. i was a baby.  a fucking baby. i didn't know anything. i was innocent. can't they hear that? i was a fucking child.

to start as a child i was dumb and naive. maybe thats why my grandfather molested me. after my dad left me, my mom and i had to live with my grandparents. everything me and my mom did was wrong in my grandma's eyes. nothing was ever good enough. 

my grandpa never had to tell me to stay quiet. he just knew i wouldn't speak a word. not saying its my fault--i was 10 years old. i just wish i wasn't so fucking naive. why couldn't i be a snake like most kids my age at the time? why did i have to be so nice? why couldn't i stand up for myself?

i can't open up to my parents who i still live with by the way. they literally get angry when i try to open up to them emotionally so i just don't. they'd really prefer a son that didn't feel anything and just stayed stoic and did his job. i tried to be that son and i failed. now i can't bring myself to do anything. the worst part is that i know that they wish i was more like their friends' kids, and maybe they're right. maybe i should be less like me, or maybe i should just not exist. but who do i turn to if not the two people who are always supposed to be there?

and my friends, well, peers i guess. i only have like three i can really talk to and they're busy with things all the time. so it's just me really. me and this post. 

i always felt that if i did end it, there wouldn't be that many people at the funeral. maybe some family, but then in the end after a year, nobody's life would really change. i'm already a ghost. i just have to finish it.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"this isn't allowed on r/amitheasshole so im putting it here me and my girlfriend were having a discussion and somehow it turned into us talking about abortion. i told her that if she was raped, and got pregnant, then i would still want her to have that child and let me and her raise that baby as our own (bc even if its not blood related i would still treat that child like its mine). 

its the same with if i were to adopt a child, which she is totally for. i would raise that child like it was my own blood, no matter how it came into this world. 

her reasoning (to my understanding) is that she wouldn't want to remember being raped, everytime she looked at that child. i say that's bs. my mother had me at 17 to an unknown man. she doesn't know who my father is out of a few men. regardless of the fact that she was a stupid teenager, she doesn't think if all of her past mistakes when she looks at me, and about all the bad guys she was with. i want to give my child, yes my child because if i am the one that is raising that child and taking care of it on my own accord, then that is my child, the beast freaking life possible, just like i would if that child was mine. 

if i were to be raped (bc big surprise guys get raped too) and the person who raped me had a kid, i would fight for custody over that child like they were the last thing on earth that i could ever love. i'm honesty curious to see weather or not my girlfriend would dump me for me wanting to have that child.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"i can't escape my mindi've been a lurker for a few months now, never had the courage to write a post. so i lost my girlfriend of 2+ years a few months ago. i ended our relationship because i felt like i had to clear my head from all the constant suicidal thoughts i've been having for a year and from all the pain from ex partners. two weeks ago, i decided i was ready to pick up what was left of our relationship but i found out that she's seeing someone else. and honestly i relapsed. i fell back into the suicidal thoughts and it feels like i can't outrun all the memories and that i'm constantly drowning in my mistakes.

the past week, it seemed like the both of us were fine again. but i found out that she's been seeing him behind my back. sending her home, meeting her. and i just feel so fucking hopeless. i feel like i'm in this constant back and forth, swinging in and out of all the negativity and the hurt swirling around in my head and all i just want to do right now is end everything. i tried to end my life twice now the past two weeks. the first time was when i found out and a driver pulled me off the road. the second time was last night when i zoned out and found myself on the road half an hour later. i'm so scared. but i've no one to run to. nowhere to go.

i love her so much. 

but she'd rather be with someone else and honestly it sucks so fucking hard. i hate him so much. what he's done to her, the way he plays her like a fool and all i can do is sit by and watch her drift away from me as i try my very hardest to swim against the current, to hold on to all that i have. 

all i've thought about the entire morning was how she could tell me she loved me right after he sent her home. i placed my trust in her. i gave her my all. i thought things were okay. she wanted out with her friends and i was okay with that. all that mattered to me was her, and i thought i had her completely. i keep apologizing because i just feel it's my fault, for letting her go four months ago. i shouldn't have. it's my fault and i'm just a failure through and through. 

when we're together, it just feels so natural. even after four months of absence, we just fall right back together and it feels so fucking right. and i don't know if i'll ever forgive myself if i let that go. but i guess she has and i don't want to. maybe i just don't want to see myself let go, i don't want to face reality. i don't want to constantly try to outrun my fears, my memories with her because i know i'll lose. i always do. 

frankly, i don't know where to go from here. maybe i just don't want to go anywhere at all. and honestly, i'd rather end my own life than see her with someone else knowing that at the end of the day, i couldn't even hold on to what meant the most to me.",suicide,suicide,1.0

the thing is i just missed class (again) because i just didn't feel like going to it. my depression has gotten worse. much worse. i called my grandma who i'm close to and the only one who i can really talk to about these things, even though i leave my suicidal thoughts out of it. she's gone through depression spells 3 times in her 80+ years of life.

i feel like i've been on a downward spiral for a long time, if it's just going to get worse i don't want to suffer through it. i don't care about school right now, i don't care about anything, except that i always try to stick it through so i don't hurt my grandma by killing myself, but it's just getting so hard.

"the time has come to say goodbye....goodbye to the struggle against depression, feelings of inadequacy, the constant uphill battle to be morally just, the relentless pursuit of trying to build a better, more stable and lucrative life. facts are facts. at this point in my life i will probably never find a wife or have the chance to raise a child, to watch him or her grow up, to pass on the wisdom that comes from living the hard life, all the while providing a better life for them than you ever had. i have been proactively working towards these goals, just trying to get myself to a point that i actually liked who i am, and although almost there, still i can't get a date, much less a girlfriend. i have recently been trying to help a sibling, well 2 of them, but the main one is a junkie and a thief and never ever fails to make me regret ever lifting a finger for him, and he has no idea that i am barely hanging on myself, and honestly, he is so selfish and all about himself and his struggle and what he can get from others that it would be pointless to even explain to him. well, fucker is gonna truly be on his own here shortly, only wish him the best.

"getting worse, deteriorating self worthwas at the coffee shop several days ago, that i go to, so i can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter. she had heard from one of the other workers that i liked to draw and asked if i could draw. i smiled and said yes. she asked me if i could paint and i said that i could. nothing fancy of course. i told her about how i've been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there, but i didn't want to go alone.

this girl responded with, ""i'd love to go!"". i was in shock when i heard this, as i'm in my early 30s and have been rejected by girls since i first tried at 16. i've always been socially awkward, and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment.

i told her i was surprised by her response and how the previous girl i asked to go out there, thought i was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store. she gave a sad ""aww, why?"" and i told her i had no idea.

she asked when i wanted to go and i told her that my schedule is usually free, so whatever time is convenient for her. she said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her. i was actually feeling somewhat happy, just knowing i'd be able to go out with someone and do something fun. i told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time, and proceeded to give her my number. my anxiety since then has been really high consistently. 

fast forward a few days and i hadn't received any call or text, so when i finally met her at the coffee shop again, i asked her if she still wanted to go paint. she told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it, only to find it in her work attire. she sent me a text to confirm the number and i added her to my contacts.

that girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop, but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me. 2 days would go by until i gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her. her response was, ""i've been really busy"". i broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that i was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to. i thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me.

her response was one of the kindest i've ever had from anyone, more so from a girl. she offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me. i sent a few more texts about how miserable i've felt just being stuck in my head, and how i couldn't believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life. she shared her own experiences and i could actually relate to her. at this point i started to fall more in love i guess. at the end of the night we sat outside and talked, i almost started crying while talking to her, because the more she shared, the more i could relate; until another worker who i think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something. i had to use the restroom so i gave in and said yes, jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure. i try as hard as i can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me, just to avoid the anger i have from setting off stupid aggressive people.

we get up and meet at the diner, where it's now 4 of us, including another worker, and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl, turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they've never experienced the hardships i've had to go through and shared their own stories. i could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as i shared. i couldn't bring myself to share everything i wanted to with the girl, just to connect with her. i wanted to so much, but there i was, locked in my fucking head, fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone. it was about 3 in the morning when we finally got up, the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story. 

we had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold, the girl was shivering and that one other guy (not in a relationship with her) opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm. i looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked, but i couldn't get that out of my head, even as it continued for a minute. when i got back to the car, i put my head down, wanting to just disappear. my anger  and sadness was overwhelming, partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl, and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind, which brought more shit from my past flooding forward. when i got home, i sent her a message saying i shouldn't have agreed to that group sitting, that it was extremely painful for me.

the next day when i went to draw at the coffee shop, that guy with the motorcycle never showed up. i could barely look the girl in the face, and i sent more texts about how miserable i felt, but there was no response, until closer to the end of the day. my depression from opening up, was getting extremely bad. once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses i've ever received. when i got home i had more conversation with her and i broke down, because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable. her kindness had brought my depression down, and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to. i told her, ""you helped me, so i'm going to help you."" i offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place. she refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that, and seeing the money. at this point was extremely embarrassed standing there, around other patrons and some of the other works. i didn't think she understood how much she just helped me, perhaps saved me, so i insisted, and she refused again. so partly in anger, i left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn't. i was fully intending to do that, because her helped meant the world to me and i refused to take it back, but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn't earned it and refused to accept it.  my response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before.

i finally gave in and took the money back. i got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn't fair, how i felt useless when she refused my help. i felt even more miserable on my way home. i think i probably freaked her out after that incident. i sent more texts trying to talk to her, wanting to just be with someone, somewhere. 

not stuck in my fucking head!

either that night or the next, i left the house. she had stopped responding to my texts. sent multiple texts describing how i had no idea where my life was going. i told her i wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise. i didn't want to be alone, i was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head. i wanted to tell her that i wanted to be with her, more than anything. all i could muster was just statements of loneliness. what transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up. i took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her, with the message, ""even though you didn't accept the money, please accept this sunrise as my thank you."". i was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home (from being awake all night). i sent one last message saying i was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great!

there hadn't been any responses for the past day (something she never let drag on), and i figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy, as she repeatedly implied when i asked about going to paint. regardless, i felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as i fell asleep, i actually was able to drift off without too much trouble.

when i woke up several hours later today, there was still no response since the night before. i decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop, and try to relax as best i could with this depression constantly there. i got to the coffee shop and the girl was there, she asked me if i'd gotten some rest, which implied that she had read everything i sent. further more, she said nothing about the sun rise photos that i sent her. all she mentioned was me getting some rest. i put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise, (there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic.)

depression kicked in heavily and i ordered something, before sitting down and drawing, trying to tune out everything around me. the two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well. through out the day i could hear the 3 of them laughing, and picked out several comments making fun of me. i removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn't have to see any more depressing things from me, and i'm sure there's not going to be any painting with someone else. i felt myself shrinking further, and further inwards. smaller, smaller, smaller, nothing, just not wanting to be here anymore.

i wrote in my sketchpad,

""you asked me if i got rest, that told me you read the messages. i had to piece two and two together that i was talking to myself. i removed you from my contacts so you don't have to read my stuff any more. i thought the sunrise photos were nice. if you care, please speak to me in person. show me through your actions. i let you in.""

""invite me out, ask me to hang out, show me you care.""

"gradually thinking more and moreon a throwaway, not surprising i'm sure.    
ultimately i feel i need to just get this out.  i'm honestly not too concerned about advice (i can't imagine too much that can help anyway), but i really just want to be able to express my concerns openly and this seems the perfect place for it.    
to start with, i'm a sharp guy.  always have been smart, i completely understand my pains and fully aware of their sources, their ways of being handled, and i've always felt i can't ask for help.  i've always been the go-to guy for everything.    
right now, i'm torn about my emotional standing.  i'm currently in classes, in my third semester and currently in my mid 20's.  i feel disgusted that i waited so long and it hurts me even more that i can't work to handle money issues.    
as far as money issues, it's not all that complex.  i am married, my wife has a ba.  however she works for 3 hours a day, making a pittance.  we currently live with my mother.  i honestly find myself blaming my wife for these concerns about money and why we live with my mom now because she could easily get a full time job, but insists she can't find anything (she hasn't honestly looked in nearly a year now).  on the other hand, i desperately want to be the husband that ""brings home the bacon"" and she has expressed wanting to just be a housewife.  i'm happy with that idea, but we can't do that until i finish school.    
with at the very least another year left before i can get my aa, and another two for a ba (which is what i really want at least), it makes me feel like i'm not doing my duty for not handling the money issues by working myself, however i'm purposely taking a large amount of units to try to get my schooling done as soon as possible (for instance, this semester i'm at 19 units, 12 is the amount taken for full time status).  as it were, i could only hope to work part time on the weekends, leaving me no time for studies or recreation if i did.    
ultimately i know i have no right to blame my wife, however i also realize i worked full time while she finished her degree.  a degree that has done practically nothing but land her into a few thousand dollars in debt.  again, it's not fair for me to blame her about that, but i feel the strain for the result.    
living with my mother wouldn't be so bad, except i resent my mother deeply.  she purposely mocks me in many ways and undermines much of what i'm trying to do.  she has more than once told me that i ""should have said something"" when i was younger and dropped out of college after high school.  she would have helped me.  frankly i know this is complete bullshit.  she knew completely what i was doing back then and why i dropped out and refused to support me.  even now she makes sure to constantly hound me about projects at home that she knows i can't take care of until at the earliest spring break and frustrates me with how much needs to be done.  were that not enough, i know that when i have a chance to take care of these projects (and she knows when i'll be available), she won't have the money, instead spending it on garbage products from a catalog.    
i find myself constantly frustrated at home and at school.  i feel i have no close friends and for any type of discussion like this, i can't tell anyone near me.  i refuse to discuss any of this with my wife because she already has a good idea of what bothers me and knows there's nothing that can be done for the above.  i find myself wanting to make more ""mature"" friends than i often end up with at school so that i can have meaningful relationships, but at the same time i can't get over my own insecurities about approaching these sorts of people.  i don't like going out drinking, which is a popular activity here, and i feel that i would need to take that up if i wish to make friends with most people here.    
i recently expressed a concern to my wife about the rifle we have in the house.  a simple .22 squirrel rifle that my father had for a few decades.  it's sat in the corner of our back room for a while, resting in it's case.  i had it there because of a concern several months ago that a neighbor might get violent and just needed the peace of mind within reach.  i had loaded the gun with i believe a half dozen bullets (even though it can hold many more), the chamber left empty, but still ready to go with a single cock and removing of the safety.    
not too long ago i had looked at the rifle and the thought occurred to me how easy it would be to just take the rifle, place it at my forehead, and pull the trigger.  how i could so simply end it.  at the time, i had no particular feeling of depression that i was aware of, but the vivid thoughts fed me.  as sick as it sounds typing it, it sounded delightful.  absolutely delightful!  i didn't think about not having to deal with any responsibilities i didn't like or anything like that.  instead i couldn't help thinking about the blood splatter and brain matter that would be plastered on the walls and how my wife or mother might react upon hearing the shot and coming into the room and seeing me there on the ground.    
i also felt deeply surprised and scared.  i've never felt so clearly interested in suicide in my life.  even after some traumatic experiences in my younger years (my brother was killed when i was 14 and my father passed away from a second stroke a couple of years ago).  i can't help thinking that i'm honestly not suicidal, but at the same time i feel that i'm just denying it.  i've always believed that no one honestly wants to kill themselves.  they just have something in their lives that they don't want to live with anymore.  from there, i've always considered myself a fighter and not interested in just letting an issue pull me down.  and yet here i am, starting to feel worried about myself.    
    
another thing to mention is i really don't know where to turn.  i feel that i'm keenly aware of my problems and a help line or some other source of help couldn't give me advice that i'm not fully aware that i should do already.  it seems like a waste of time to me, to the person(s) that have to hear me, and to even make myself get worked up over what should really be nothing.  as mentioned, i can't talk to my wife and i don't dare say a word to friends.  i have no family to talk to, other than my mother who would be the last person i'd ever discuss these matters with for the sake of my sanity.  if anyone could inadvertently drive me to suicide, it would be her.    
    
so really i don't know what i'm after here.  i felt i needed to just put it out there and there is definitely a level where i feel better after typing this all up.  these issues seem so petty now, yet i know they'll pop up again later to bother me.  i can't help thinking about one other thing.  i've seen my father cry.  it was one of the most devastating things i've seen in my life.  i felt that nothing could bring my father down, he stood so firm and in control of himself and others around him (even when i watched him not get his way and make a fool of himself often enough).  when i saw him cry, it crushed me for seeing what was a pillar of strength just crumble.  it's one of the main reasons i try my hardest to prevent anyone from ever seeing me cry.  i want to be a cornerstone for others and can't let them see i'm prone to crumbling as well.  it's probably a huge factor why i refuse to seek help.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"went home early from work today and am having bad thoughtsthis is probably going to be a long one but i think i just need to let it out. i guess to begin with i've had a history of depression but i've been off my antidepressants for about a year now. when i first started on them almost 2 years ago i still wound up in the bathroom about ready to slit my wrists with a knife. my best friend called and i answered and she was able to talk me out of it. the next day i checked myself into a behavioral health hospital. i spent a little over a week there. i returned to work and all was fine for about another 2 weeks. i had a seizure that seemed to have come out of nowhere. for the previous 6 months i had a problem with auditory and visual hallucinations (the doctor chalked it up to be from my depression). i saw my doctor the next day and immediately had me go get an mri of my head done. that's when we found that i had a golf ball sized arachnoid cyst in my brain. from there everything snowballed. i only lasted a month before i had to go on medical leave at work. seizure after seizure (even on antiseizure meds), a plethora of neurological issues; such as convulsions, dry heaving for hours, hallucinations getting worse. my right leg one day become completely paralyzed and once the feeling came back i could no longer walk on my own, i had to use a cane. i went through several neurologists either telling me i had epilepsy, or that it was all in my head. after 5 months of this i was finally able to get a neurosurgeon to perform the surgery to drain the cyst. it took about 6 months after the surgery (about this same time last year) to finally feel normal. my doctor was certain that the cyst had caused my depression and i felt comfortable to get off the meds, all of my meds. and i was fine. 

january of this year i got the okay to start working again. i didn't like my job that i had left to go on medical leave so i decided to get a new one. it took me about 2 months to find the job i am at now. it's not great, but has been okay enough. i liked it for the first couple months until this lady (k) on my team decided that she doesn't have to do anything. we get a bonus based on how many ""tasks"" we do in our queue, but have a ton of other things we have to that don't count towards our ""tasks"". you can probably see the issue here. k only does the tasks and leaves the rest up to me and whoever else is on our team (we've had a lot of turnover because of this). i've talked to my managers about k multiple times, every time someone requests to be transferred to a different department it's all the same reasoning. but she's been here for 3 years and her production numbers makes them ""look good"" (that's the only reason me and a lot of the other people in our office think of as to why they would hold onto her). three months ago we got a new (well another new since we've been though about 4 at this point) girl (l) and we immediately hit it off. i was in charge of training l and she was doing great. we both get our work done and don't obsess over production. we had an issue with k for all the same reasonings so they decided to once again hire a new person and split the team. me and l, and k with the newest addition (s). it had been working out.

well, 3 weeks ago i had a seizure at work. i've known for a while something hasn't been right but i've been too afraid to say anything. i haven't had the crippling depression, but i've had more frequent headaches, the vision and auditory hallucinations, the random dizzy spells and nausea. i hid this from everyone, and i was probably kidding myself thinking this may just be from the aftermath of having had brain surgery last year. i knew something was up but didn't want to face it in fear of the worst, that the cyst came back. i just didn't want to know until i couldn't be ignorant anymore. so, until i had the seizure. went to my doctor the next day, this time i was still suffering from severe postictal symptoms and they sent me straight to the er to get a ct scan done. the hospital lied to me about my results, said that everything looked normal, and sent me home with some antiseizure meds and said to follow up with a neurologist. 

my primary care doctor had me come in a week later, i hadn't gone to work since i was having bad side effects from the antiseizure meds. he told me that the ct scan report does say that i have fluid built up in my brain in the same spot my cyst was. we can't classify it as a cyst yet since that's all the report said, i still have to get the mri done.

my doctor wrote me a note and said i could go back to work the following monday. i've almost made it two weeks back to work and have had to call out twice and leave to go home early a couple times from not feeling well. i've had 3 more seizures, been living on pain meds since my excruciating headache just doesn't seem to go away. my manager has been understanding and very adamant about me not getting stressed out over work and that my health should come first. 

which brings me to today. they sent out an email saying they are moving l to a different department. which means our team won't be separated anymore, and i will have to pick up after k's unending slack. at least l made working bearable, especially these past couple weeks. i don't even know if i'll have the stamina to deal with k. i can hardly concentrate on what i'm doing. i would put in my two weeks but i need the health insurance and obvisouly need to pay my bills. i know very well that my managers aren't going to do anything about k. i'm going to be stuck doing the majority of the work while she makes her bonus. all the stress over this triggered an episode and i wound up having to leave early and go home. i just don't want to deal with this. my head hurts, my body is shaking. i don't want to go on medical leave because i need the money and i used the majority of my pto for that week i took off. how am i supposed to live? pay bills? i was lucky enough to have my stepdad basically pay for everything last time i was sick since disability hardly pays anything. i just feel stuck. it was almost enough dealing with the office drama when i was okay but now i feel awful and can barely make it out of bed in the morning. what the hell am i supposed to do? i just feel like i'm screwed no matter what. it's like yeah sure i could might be able tough it out for another excruciating 6 months but i really don't want to. i've been through watching my body fall apart and what this stupid thing in my head does to me. i just don't want to deal with this anymore. 

anyways, thank you for reading if you've made it this far. i probably just needed to let it out or something.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i am lost, please talk to mei have become what i decided to work as hard as possible to never become. one day when i was a teenager i spoke with a guy in his thirties and he was really struggling with money, driving a car that looked like it was ready to be retired, and just generally unhappy with life.

that moment burned itself into my mind. i decided to go to college. work as hard as possible in my job. eventually graduate and move up to some sort of white collar position. i wanted to experience life and make sure i wouldn't have to struggle with money like i did when i was younger.  


it didn't happen. i couldn't make it happen. i had a couple failed relationships, the last one really seemed like it was going to be the one that led to marriage. we both were on the same page. i blew it though. i can't keep up with relationships. i can't provide girlfriends with the attention they need. i can barely fake it. i reach a point where i lose all focus and just self destruct. 

i do this with jobs too. i put forth everything i have in the beginning and get noticed and apply to advance and usually do. then after about a year something happens and i sabotage myself. show up late. call in too much. those are the main ways. 

eventually i'll get fired. then i'm in need of a new job, however, this is my main problem; i don't apply for anything. i have a mental problem i think. i always wait for an opportunity someone comes to me with and it's usually something terrible, but i don't feel worthy of anything else. 

i couldn't make it on my own. i'm back at my parents and in a downward spiral. i don't do well in my hometown. i am falling apart and can't get my failures out of my head. my best friend of over 20 years seems to be moving on.

"things should be better, but i want to end ittldr; i am a fit, tall, intelligent dude from the midwest with a wife and loving family; but i just can’t shake the creeping thoughts of wanting to hang myself every day in our apartment.

i graduated college late with a less than stellar gpa due to switching schools and majors midway through a tech track, and ended up with a general degree that employers won’t even look at. i’ve been unemployed from my last job for about three months which was a warehouse position with a coffee roaster, in which i got let go due to performance.

since then, i’ve sent massive amounts (&gt;150 per month) of applications out to various postings and have had one interview in the beginning of my unemployment. i have never not been without job opportunities.

i’ve stopped enjoying everything that used to help me relax or make me feel empowered, i haven’t gone to the gym more than once a week and none last week. this has led to my wife and i not having any intimate relations in the past couple of months, and i feel completely out of sync with her on everything going on.

my family is loving, but my mom is going to die soon. she has four different types of cancer, ms, and onset heart failure, and i can’t do anything to help her. i visit, but since the last episode of cardiac arrest in which she suffered prolonged oxygen depletion, she doesn’t recognize me.

i should feel like there’s hope, i just don’t or can’t. i have a degree, i’m abled bodied, i can (somewhat) string together cohesive thoughts, but i’m so disillusioned by life i don’t see a point in being here. i’m holding my wife back from living life, and wasting the time of everyone around me who’s invested in me succeeding and feeling something.
i feel like i’m displacing opportunities for those around me to find happiness, where they’re wasted on me.

i feel selfish for wanting to go, because there are so many of you who have it way worse than me. you have had brutalities enacted on you that don’t have an expression for how bad they are.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm so donewell, this is where i've come to. after years of shitting on reddit, here i am again. full disclosure, i'm only 16 and a senioir in highschool, but whatever. i have nobody to turn to rn. so, here we go.

i've attempted suicide 47 times? i think? it's gotten to the point where even i can't remember. i've used weed, and almost every time it's been a fake dab cart, leading me to trip balls on dmt for hours. i can't remember the last time i was happy.

but that's not true. i can. it was with my ex. and sure, everyone tells me to ignore them, but that's hard when i fall in love incredibly quickly, with this one at literal first meeting. i've been at such a loss since we dated multiple times, each time to no avail. i keep finding myself in worse and worse positions. i just want to sleep and never wake up, bc i'm simply too much of a pussy to actually kill myself.

but that doesn't mean that i won't do something dumb. i keep confessing my feelings to this ex of mine, and they just ignore me. they see me and looks the other way, even turning around at times to avoid me. and that hurts; i'm literally in love with this person, and cannot get them out of my head. i don't expect anything to change, but in my disoriented state of sadness and overwhelming fear of dying alone, i find myself wanting them to just come back. i don't know what i expect to get from this, but any sort of comment will likely be welcome. i just don't have anyone to turn to, nobody to love, and nobody to love me. so i guess what i'm saying is this - i might not come back to this post. i just want this all to go away without feeling any pain. i simply want to feel less of this bullshit. anyone here got any advice, cool. i might need this shit.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my dad just died. i don't know what to do.hi.

you can call me jake; but that’s not my real name. it’s a nice name to have though.

i’m not exactly suicidal. sure, i’ve thought about it. but not in the sense most people do; at least not in the sense i think most people do. but i really need to talk to someone and i hope you can spare a few minutes.

as a person, i’m as generic as it gets. i feel joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and every other emotion a human being generally does. i like having people around. i like my friends. i love my family. i’m concerned about the current political situation. i’m very displeased about pollution. i even feed stray dogs and homeless people.

but that’s only an image; a mask. whenever i’m alone i start to talk to myself in second person. it’s almost subliminal. i tell myself how i should’ve done things, and how i should proceed. i teach myself how to blend in, and manipulate.

i’m very good at using other people to do things for me. when i’m with people i can get along with anyone. we always have something in common. something we both love. if i don’t know much about it, i will have by the end of the conversation and the other person would think that i was genuinely interested. i really am, most of the time; at least i’d like to think so. all in all, i have a lot of friends, powerful and powerless.

i can seem very concerned about other people’s troubles and i might even help them to the best of my ability. the truth is that i don’t really care, or feel sad about anyone, or anything. i just think what someone else would’ve done and emulate. years of observation has helped me get very good at this. and once i’m alone again, i try to find something to keep myself busy. i usually play random scenarios in my head.

i’ve thought about suicide. not because i’d been depressed or sad, or because i had problems in life. ( come to think of it, i never had problems in my life. everything just played out nicely. ) i’ve thought of suicide as a method to a grand scheme. a well versed, well planned drama. a mystery to remain unsolved for centuries after my death. it’s already done inside my head. i only have to execute, once there isn’t enough stimulation around and i’m literally bored to death.

i watch movies. i’ve watched a lot of sad movies lately. just to try and feel something. i didn’t cry when schindler said that he could’ve saved one more; or when old yeller died. but later at night i could force myself to cry by imagining myself in certain tragic situations and then emulating. it was almost real.

every emotion i feel is emulated. it’s never real. and i know this is not how it’s supposed to be because i’ve seen how others act and react. even in movies and books, they *feel*. so i really want to know. is this how everyone feels? are your emotions just emulated to fit the situation too? or am i deranged?

why am i writing this now, after 25 years of existence?

i was very close to my father. we have a beer or two every sunday by the pool, and talk about things; mostly life and politics. i often stay there for dinner. he cooks a very nice steak.

a week ago, i got a call saying that he’s been run over by a car and killed. i didn’t start doing anything until i’d finished the movie i was watching. and then i called the funeral home, did what a good son would’ve done, and went on with my life. i don’t even miss him.

it doesn’t seem right what i did. so i decided to write this, and put it up in the internet so i could get some external advice on how to proceed. and i'm sorry about the edgy title. i had to get as much viewers as possible for a better probability of quality input.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i don't feel like i can resist much longer (wife of ten years just left me out of the blue)my wife of ten years just left me for another man. we had a storybook marriage, i thought so at least, and she sure did pretend like we did i guess.  all our friends and family are so shocked by her actions, no one saw this coming, no one suspected a thing.   


it's been 16 days since she left me, she left me in the worst possible way. she left for work and i thought everything was fine, didn't have any reason not too. a few hours later she sent me a text saying she wants a divorce, won't talk to me on the phone, won't come home, won't even reply to 99% of my text messages. i am pretty much being ghosted by the woman i've spent the last ten years building an amazing life with.   


she told me she was staying at a friends house and disabled the find my friends app we always have turned on (just for convenience out shopping and such) i asked her why she did that and she of course didn't reply. she told me for 5 days that she just needed time to think, so i gave her time and was sure she would come around, after all out of all our friends and family me and here had by far the best marriage. we use to feel sad for people who weren't as connected as us, who never fought like us, who never raised their voices to one another like us. we had a perfect marriage and would always talk about what our 50th anniversary would be like one day.   


one major detail i left out about her timing. she decided to leave me the day before a major surgery i needed. i had no one to check me out of the hospital and ended up having to fly my mom up to check me out (no friends or near by relatives could do it on such short notice) i was then left alone to recover while being really fucked up physically from the surgery (some of the worst physical pain of my life) i never complained to her about this, i didn't want to make her feel bad in anyway, i assumed the stress from work and this looming surgery and whatnot caused her to have a mini breakdown or something and i just wanted to make her life as stress free as possible while she worked threw it (at her friends house.)   


well 5 days after my surgery i remembered i could use the find my iphone app to see her location, the only reason i did this is because she hadn't spoken to me in days (not even text) and i was worried so i contacted the friend she was staying with to see how she was doing and tell her to call me when she gets a chance, the friend replied ""i'll text her"" which seemed really odd to me considering how much of a homebody both these girls are (my wife and her friend) so i looked up the location and low and behold she's not at her friends house. well maybe she just went to visit another friend i thought. i sent her a text saying i saw her location and she isn't where she said she'd be staying, she assured me she was in fact staying with said friend and the gps location is just wrong because of really spotty service there. i wanted to believe that so bad that i ended up convincing myself that must be what's going on. i knew what time she got off work the next day and decided to watch the live stream of the location as she drove to her friends house (just to confirm it was the gps being wonky) well low and behold she drove straight to the new house again. i called her as soon as she pulled into the driveway but she of course declined the call. all sort of alarm bells started going off then. i sent her a text message with her location and said if she didn't tell me what's going on i'd be coming down to pound of the door.   


this is when she told me about the other man, and how in love with him she is, and how wonderful he is, and how despite seeming incredible happy she'd been very unhappy for years (which i don't believe) she then listed off some  incredibly tiny problems we have (all which could have been fixed with a short honest conversation, i didn't know they were problems because she always acted like they weren't, just talking about some simple choir stuff like laundry) she then told me she's been abusing pain killers for the last 6 months and that's why she recently lost a bunch of weight (i was so proud of her for losing it and so supportive of what i thought were clean healthy efforts to get healthy)  


i feel like i've lost my whole world, i feel like i've lost my best friend and the only woman i've ever loved so intensely. she's like a completely different person now, the tone of her voice, the way she looked at me when i walked into her work to see her, everything about her actions.   
she turned down a big promotion at work she had been working towards for years, started going out to bars (she hates bars so maybe the new guy is responsible for that, i dont know) and doesn't want to even attempt to save our marriage or salvage the life we've built. i was willing to forgive her for everything, willing to see this as a huge mistake just brought on by the stresses of life but she just wants to be with the new guy now. my family is so shocked, she was so close to them all, i use to joke that they liked her more than me. she's even talking about moving across the country to be with the new guy since he's only here for a short time for work.   


i can't stop picturing them together, i can't stop seeing her look at him with her twinkling eyes the way she use to look at me, making love to him and cumming on his dick instead of mine (our sex life was amazing) rubbing his chest afterwards like she did to me, making breakfast in the mornings with a big smile like she use to do for me.   


everyday is worst than the last, everyday is more painful than the day before. every morning when i wake up i don't remember what's going on for a few seconds and then all the memories and pain come rushing in and i feel like a crushing weight is on me.   


i don't sleep more than 2 hours a night, i barely eat, i am off of work for a while because of this surgery so all i do is lie in bed and think, think, think. i am glad i don't have work tho because i would probably lose my job right now. i can barely bring myself to shower every couple of days.   


she bought me a nice .44 magnum revolver 8 years ago as a birthday present. i have it out of the case lately and find myself pushing it to the side of head a lot, picturing what it would be like to pull the trigger. the only thing that's been stopping me is i don't want to hurt my family. but that motivation fades a little more each day. i've even written my suicide note now to post on facebook right before i pull the trigger. basically just a big apology to my friends and family for being too weak to handle all this.   


i just want my old life back, i just want my best friend back but it's over now, even if she came back the trust is gone, things will never be the same, our relationship will always be shaky and weird.   


i can't stand the thought of being with another woman, she even told me she hopes i find someone soon and move on, that really fucked me up, how could she picture me with another woman and not have her heart break.  


i don't know if i'll pull the trigger or not, but the desire to do it grows everyday, honestly i'll be surprised if i make it through the week.  


i want to end my pain, but i also want to do it because she is now pretending i don't exist, that the last ten years never happened. ""well she wont have to pretend much longer"" is a thought i find myself having often. i wonder if i do it if she'll even be regretful or just be relieved to be able to move on easier now with her new man.

"i just don't know any moreso i detoxed off a drug subutex last year and got 8 months clean after 10 years on it prescribed. it holds a big taboo in society. 

had a break up after 7 years, lost my apartment after 3 years. moved home, got a new place 5 months ago,, after 5 months moving into the new place i left my stressful job. after the break up my doctor put me back on a micro dose of 0.25mg of the med. 

now the last 4 days i've been sober(not tonight) and started to really get my ass kicked. i was drinking every day since my ex moved away, abusing and snorting my meds, drinking, doing coke on a weekly basis that i've kept hidden. 

now that i've been trying to get clean, i don't know what i'm withdrawing from at times anymore. i'm in far worse shape than months ago, or even this time last year.

i feel like i'm never gonna beat all this and keep fucking up, even with long sprints sober. thinking about all this makes me wanna just die, knowing everything is gone, and i can't seem to escape addiction, failure, living up to expectations, being so behind at my age and rejected by everyone.

i just don't know how this is gonna go and after 37 years... i'm just tired guys.

"feeling suicidal before my datethis is my first post on this community.i have always found it very difficult to share things on internet forums like these openly, even though it is anonymous. to me it is almost like leaving a piece of me out there and scary. almost like it will come back to haunt me.
   the only reason i have pushed myself to write here is because of some hope that what if somebody can really understand? my parents separated four years ago and i am pretty much on my own. all my life i have only seen them break off ties, not just with each other but my whole extended family, their friends etc.  i have always thought of myself as a strong person but now i wonder, why does anyone matter at all? why do i matter in this word of billions of people? why stop somebody from just taking away some extra weight from this planet? why are human beings so needy? i miss having parents, a common home even though i am 27! i go on normally throughout the month but around my date, i start thinking about taking all the pills in the medicine box or doing something rash but i somehow in the end calm down. i wonder if this would last though. i have my reservations about therapy as crying gives me migraines. i feel stupid writing all of this here, sharing it with so many people. i find myself almost not posting it but what bad can come out of it? humans may be the most evolved species but why then do we need so much care? i hardly talk to my parents anymore, they just make it worse.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"survivor of a mother who committed suicide, survivor of a personal attempt as well.i was twelve years old when i found my mother's body. she had been going through a lot of life changes, moving out to be closer to me (where my dad was raising me), having trouble keeping a job, and not having a strong support system out here. she had dealt with depression and alcoholism for as long as i remember. she never sought therapy or any type of mental health. 

she was a beautiful and intelligent person who was well liked by so many people, but even the most popular of people have it rough. especially when you become really good at hiding the pain because you're ashamed of it. 

again, i was young and finding her body did a lot to me psychologically. i don't wish to go into gory details, but i will tell you that she had used pills and left a note. the note pretty much said she was tired of the pain and she felt like she had been drowning for so long and couldn't ask for help after she had asked for financial help so many times before. my dad was dropping me off for my weekend with mom when i found her. i had unlocked the door, saw her lying there (she had been there a few days so i knew right away there was no reviving her) and i ran out to catch my dad before he drove away. i cried a lot. i didn't understand a lot. they had therapists come talk to me and give me a teddy bear (ironically, my daughters favorite teddy bear now). they asked me if i wanted to talk to someone and i said yes, my 5th grade teacher. they contacted her and she came out and i talked to her as well. everyone was really nice to me, i didn't really understand why. i was in a state of shock for a long time.

my father didn't know how to deal with the situation. he figured if he just swept this whole event under the rug and not talk about it, it would go away. i was never put in therapy or grief counselling. in fact, he refused to fly me out to my mothers funeral that was going to be in her home town. i resented him a lot for that then, but understand now that he didn't know what he was doing or how to deal with everything that happened. he just became super strict about school. i got grounded any time i got something lower than a ""c"". he would yell at me a lot about things, i felt like i was constantly fucking up and that i couldn't do anything right. i missed my mom horribly. she always accepted me and forgave my mistakes. i started having thoughts at 12 that if i didn't do well on a test then i would go home and kill myself so i wouldn't hear dad yell at me. 

one night i confronted my dad about what i was thinking and feeling and he told me that the only reason i was having these feelings was because my mom committed suicide and i wanted attention. he didn't take me seriously. he continued being very controlling and critical of me through my teen years, especially when he found out that i had sexual relations at 16 with my boyfriend. he made me break up with him and kept me on lock down in my house. 

finally i came home one day and i was tired of the pain. i felt this constant pain in my chest and it hurt to breathe. i felt ashamed for even existing. i felt like i had a frankenstein complex because if my creator/mother had abandon me like she did...what did that say about me? why didn't she love me enough to stay alive and raise me? why did she want to leave me forever? i went to my father's medicine cabinet and i started swallowing a bunch of pills and i drank it down with gin. 

taking pills isn't quick. in the movies it seems they would take them and a few minutes later fall asleep and die. not me. shortly after i took them i started calling people/friends asking them how there day was and telling them i would see them tomorrow. i also wrote letters to everyone apologizing for my actions and telling them i loved them. i wrote a beautiful poem and taped it to my bed post about how i was just another girl, another teen, another daughter, another drama geek, another wanna be journalist, but i was also just another person who bleeds within. then the vomiting started. it's an interesting feeling when you want to end your life so badly, but your survival instincts kick in and your body tries to save you. things started hurting, so i ran upstairs and got my dads gun which i knew he kept in his bedside table. i got into the bathtub (i figured it would be easier clean up for those left behind) and i cocked the old revolver. i know nothing about guns. nothing. it took everything i had to just cock it back (of course i was pretty intoxicated as well), and when it was cocked i thought to myself, ""well i have to kill myself now or i'll have to explain this to dad."" i pulled the trigger. *click* it wasn't loaded. i didn't know where dad kept the bullets, nor did i have a clue how to load a gun. so i figured i would just wait the pills out. 

my dad came home early that day. when i heard him come inside and walk to the kitchen i followed him in there and said, ""dad, i think i need to go to the hospital. i swallowed a lot of pills and booze."" he threw the unopened diet coke can in his hand at my head and screamed to get my insurance card and get into the damn car. i was bawling in the hospital waiting room. it didn't take them long to bring me back and have me swallow the charcoal. i kept throwing that up in a very violent way and that charcoal was leaking out of my nose and mouth. i looked like something out of a nine inch nails music video. 

through the whole ordeal my father was being negative. he left to go get dinner and a male nurse came in and talked to me. he asked me what was going on and why i had done it. i told him about how much pain i was in and how i couldn't deal. he said it was normal, especially being a teenage and my brain not being developed and dealing with chemical/hormonal overload. he said that things get dark and bad, but eventually they get better again. he said next time things get bad, just wait it out. it's hard, but so is anything that is worth while. 

anyways, i was submitted to a mental institution and it wasn't very helpful. my dad refused to pay for me to be medicated or to see a therapist. i struggled a lot. today, i am 28 years old and still alive. i've been through some heavy shit, i still think about suicide but i refuse to act upon it. not because i think it cowardly, there is nothing cowardly about wanting to end being emotionally tortured. but i don't act on it because if i wait it out long enough it gets better. i still struggle greatly with loneliness. its a big reason why i joined reddit. life will always be a challenge, it will always be hard...but so is anything else that is worth it. 

you are not alone. you don't have to feel ashamed. you don't have to hurt yourself. we are all apart of this universe. we are all connected. you matter to this universe. you make a difference whether you see it or not. don't hurt yourself because you can't cope, there are people out there that want to help you cope. they want to share their time with you and hear about you, your life, your loves, your interests. okay? reach out to people. i mean, literally, what else do you have to lose?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"toothache might be the final push towards killing myselfthis is daft and gonna be rambles but i don't know what else to do right now. i've been in a dump of sadness for awhile now and recently got an incredible tooth pain stacked on top of that which has altogether been great. as far as the basic dentist stuff goes, i went in for it on tuesday and expected to have a root canal done (because that's what i was told was gonna happen), but instead just got x-rays done and told l'll go back again but i dont even fucking know when that is. as far as mental stuff, life has just been so unappealing lately and i have no interest in it or the future. i have 0 confidence in myself and no self worth and it feels like it just gets worse as each day goes by. i work through it in therapy and what not but i don't think self love is something i'll ever experience and it's rather damaging. sometimes i look in the mirror too long or start notice how uncomfortable i feel in my skin and then from there my day is just shit and i wanna hurt myself. besides self esteem, my social anxiety is crippling and because of it i can't see a future for myself,  a successful worthwhile one, once i'm done with school which is wrapping up to an end very soon. i just don't know what to do with it all. 
this has been a normal thing for the past year or so and i every now and then get to a low point where the debate of suicide comes up but i never go through it whether be because of fear of what's afterwards or something else. it's been especially terrible this past month, i relapsed and fell back into self harming again. but now there's this pressing unbearable pain that isn't just a mental thing and i want more than anything for it to just stop. it's currently 5 am and i'm at a fucking loss at what to do. i just wanna die and the thought of downing a bottle of meds to end it all, the teeth pain and the mental pain as well, feels so appealing. i finally have a pain that is physically overwhelming and might push me over to do something severe to stop it and it's somewhat comforting in a way. i still have that little fear, but this feels like a new passage as far as plans go for fucking ending myself. sorry this is all over the place and what not, i just wanted to get out all thoughts that were running about and try to distract myself from the god awful ache that's taking place right now. thanks for taking the time to read if you've made it this far.",suicide,suicide,1.0

but yeah, i'm still traumatized by those events, and i can really notice that i'm the one who's being toxic in this house. i get irritated or angry easily here, although i'm not like that outside, or when i'm with other people, because i'm not really like that, but i'm somehow easily triggered when i'm around them or when i'm in the house. i don't know why i'm being like this, but sometimes, i feel like i deserve an apology from them, specially from my mother why i became like this. as selfish as it sounds, but that's how i really feel and i just wanna get this off my chest. like, how can they be okay while i'm not? i don't want to be angry, but i just can't stop, it's not that easy, but it's also hurting me, because i also love my mom, more than i can actually imagine. i'm also angry at myself, for being angry at my mom. and it hurts me so much that i just want to kill myself already, but i can't, because first of all, i don't have the guts to do that, although i tried it before, but i got scared, and lastly, i know deep in my heart that  i don't really want to die. what i want is to just forget everything. well, i gotta admit, there are times when i really wanna do it, like i really wanna die, but i can't, because i know that'll hurt my mom so bad, and i don't want that to happen. so yeah, i don't really know what to feel. i feel so worthless, lost, scared, etc, idk.

i can't tell this to anyone, not even my closest friends, not even my so. although i really want to talk with them about this. i just wanna get this off my chest, i guess, or talk with someone to distract myself from these thoughts. i've been trying my hardest to distract myself, but nothing seems to be helping. i tried watching series, reading comics, playing games, listening to music, but yeah, i still feel like shit.

first, some background. 20yr old little girl with history of depression and 2/3 shitty failed suicide attempts. 

lots of things have happened recently. i shall summarise my shitty life:

1) parents have split up after 22+ years of marriage but are keeping me in the dark about a lot and have been fuelling my bad self-esteem most of my life. mum is a pilates (like yoga) teacher and my dad is a windsurfer, very fit/active/skinny. me, i weigh the same as my dad (5"" 9') but im as short (5""1'). you get the idea, im pretty fat. borderline obese/overweight actually, no word of a lie.

2) i hate myself - personality, body, attitude, everything. i loathe me.

3) my brother has a grudge against me

4) i am steadily losing friends, making more enemies every day

5) bullied most of childhood, yadda yadda.

6) my lecturers tell us how scriptwriters (my aspiring career) get fucked over, not paid, etc etc, basically how bleak our future is looking.

already got doubly intoxicated this evening, didn't help numb the sheer pain of living right now. what the hell have i got to live for. i screw relationships up so bad, my ex tells a stranger a year after we went out how i'm a ""psycho bitch"" (his words, not mine, darling). i wonder why xyz hasn't talked to me for a while, then i realise that it's cause i'm an insufferable cow. i feel like my counseller doesn't take me seriously anymore, she batted away my words when i told her how much i can't stand myself.

i want to die so much. just watched a horror film and seeing the violence makes me think how easy it would be to kill myself. i've tried before, pathetically, but maybe this time it would work. every time someone mentions christmas or going home i want to hide in a hole, i don't have a home to go back to. my childhood home is sold to someone else, my dad is travelling all over for work, mum said don't plan on being at hers. i am dreading the end of this uni term. i am dreading the end of uni full stop, wtf am i going to do with my crappy life?? why the fuck would anyone want to make a film with me, let alone watch it? what is the fucking point of labouring over a loving script just for some asswipe director to shit all over it and say ""hey, that's how this industry goes, kid""?? what is the point of living. someone stop me before i go for a knife.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i was offered a new job todaysomeone offered me a new job today.

i don't know if i would take it. i don't know enough details yet. but all i can think about is the guilt that i might take it and not be around long enough to make me worth hiring.

i don't need it. i have a good job, for all that it matters. the me that thinks i should keep trying wants to give it a chance. the rest of me says ""don't do it, you already have a plan""

why do i do this? i'm not happy. i'm not doing anything to fix it. i don't want to be excited about a change when i'm just going to end up in the same place. i'm just going to disappoint myself. am i going to live my whole life hoping it will get better, while i spend every day trying to destroy myself?

maybe i'll take the job. it won't matter who i disappoint when i'm gone.

i don't want it. what good is a job and money if everyone just wants to take it from you? or expects you to do something good with it? i would have been happy when i was poor if i didn't have to be alone. now i'm not poor and my only goal is the end.

i just want to throw it all away. give someone else a chance. spend it all so that the people who don't care will leave me alone because i have nothing left. but i won't. because without the good job and the nice house, i'm nothing. less than nothing.

i'm sorry. sorry for who i've been. for for who i can't be. sorry for being entitled and lazy and so unhappy with everything. i don't deserve this and so many people that deserve better get nothing.

i don't know what i'm going to do anymore. i should get rid of all my crap so i don't leave a chore for someone else when i'm gone. but even that seems to be more effort than i can manage. a burden either way.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"seriously thinking about killing myself in 4 days. it'd be a pretty good day.**major theme**: i am thinking about killing myself in 4 days.

&amp;#x200b;

**how:** constant downing of one xanax pill at a time, a swing of booze, repeat until one is gone.

&amp;#x200b;

**why:** i just can't take this pain that i feel from the love of my life / boyfriened / ex boyfriend / shitty person - all the same person.

&amp;#x200b;

**background (if don't want to know, skip down):** 

known each other since we were young kids. i loved him for years, he ended up marrying the wrong girl not me. fast forward 13 years we reconnect and instantly fall in love, which was a long time coming. especially since he told me he loved me when we were young and now and it should of been me he chose.

&amp;#x200b;

we have been dating for 3 years. after the first year and a half, we broke up. i got distant, as i am busy in grad school, and am very independent and need space. i have hobbies, driven, passions, interest, friends, goals, etc. he has no friends, no goals, no purpose. so a lot of the time he looked to me for fulfillment in his life. and as soon as i was busy, stressed, couldn't be a fantastic girlfriend all the time (yes grad school breakdowns are real, and i was reeling from depression from an abortion). these are all things i tried to make him understand but at times he didn't, but we both acted toxic sometimes, depressed sometimes, etc. 

&amp;#x200b;

then the first time i got 'distant' a year and a half into our relationship, he started seeing a new girl behind my back, and when i found out i lost it. i would go over and stand outside his house for hours in the winter telling him how i feel, depressed, stressed, how much i love him, what we can do to get better. he chose her, as he said she ""was a fun exciting option he wasn't going to pass up"". fast forward, a month and a half later, i decided to go home that day from work and kill myself. right before i did, he called me. talked to me forever. called me every day after that until he came over my house 3 days later saying he broke up with her and wanted me. she was a rebound and he never liked her. i never told him i was planning to kill myself. however, after he was about a guy friend i had that would periodically make advances on me, but i never made advances on him. so for the next two months, he would hang out with this rebound ex of his and rub it in my face while i saw at his house crying waiting for him to come home.

&amp;#x200b;

for the next year or so we were up and down. good months, bad months. good summer as i had a break from grad school, but then after grad school started he became obsessed with spending every waking moment at his parent's house. (he has 2 kids, and a house himself). to the point where every day i could hang he would say he's just going to hang at his parents. fast forward. he never came to my grandpas funeral so i didn't hang out with him 3 days later at christmas because i was mad. mad his priority that day was to go shopping with his parents and never stop at the funeral. at the start middle of february, he got mad one night i went out with my friends, and broke up with me for not calling that night before passing out. i got mad he kept breaking up with me when he was mad. so i told him were not just getting back together, but have to talk and work on things. for the first 3 weeks he couldn't take it, he wanted to be with me again right then, and said waiting shows i wasn't sure. then the last 3 weeks, he built a shrine of my things in his living room. so i began texting him more trying to work things out and not argue. but he always defaults to arguing. then last week i went over, was going to stay the night, and when he tried to have sex, i said, not yet, we need to take this slower, he got mad and told me to leave. the week after that we talked here and there but i was angry and we argued. finally the other day i'm like i'm sick of arging. let's just stop, really work on our problems, maybe therapy, be honest, and i wrote him a 6 page letter being very mature and explaing what we could activiely do to really mkae this work. then he blocked me and has me blocked for 2 days. this is something he does. often.

&amp;#x200b;

what his habits are: whenever i seem to be over it or just need time away form arguing or him stressing me out, i step back, and he comes in full force, coming to my house in the middle of the night, texting me, calling me, whatever. whenever he steps away, says he's done, like he did 2 days ago and blocked me, i throw myself to my knees begging. literally outside his house for hours (can't say how many times he's locked me out in the deaed of winter), text, calls, etc. it seems like he likes that i want him, even though he said he was done, he built a shrine and invited me over a week ago. this kid loves me, but he thinks i'm the only one doing things wrong.

&amp;#x200b;

**now:** i wasn't a great girlfriend. first i'm an intp so i'm not heavily into displaying emotions. but i have very deep emotions and an over-thinking brain that drives me insane every day of my life. but he wasn't a great boyfriend either. we could argue who did worse, but i never cheated. i never wanted anyone but him even though he has self-love issues (again no friends, no hobbies, relying on me for his happiness).

&amp;#x200b;

**what i would do wrong:** he said i never made him a priority. but grad school is difficult. i'm in an extensive program. one morning after a beautiful happy weekend, i went to school then stayed out and went out to dinner, fell asleep at my friend's house and never called. he got angry the next morning and broke up with me. then instantly wanted me to get back and i got mad that he keeps saying he's ""done"" every time he is ""mad"" at me about things i don't feel he should be mad about, or that mad about, not to break up with someone you constantly say you want to marry. grad school is hard, it's not an excuse, but 3 weeks ago i made him cookies he wouldn't accept them. i went to his house and he kicked me out. when we together i hang out with him all the time. i even told him the day he last broke up with me that i want to go have a special night out, as he loves that.

&amp;#x200b;

what else: who knows. it's not as bad as last year when he chose that other girl for a month and a half, but i think he'll come around? however, idk and i can't take waiting and being in pain. i don't deal with heartbreak well, but i never ever have wanted to kill myself to stop this pain from someone besides him. and this is my third time feeling like this. so i was thinking about doing it at his house before he gets home from work. i know it sounds dumb, but i love him and i was to be within any bit of his presence. i love him... why can't he just unblock me, and tell me he wants to work on being happy too. 

&amp;#x200b;

anyways, considering to aim for 4 days. tuesday is the perfect day, plus its beautiful to sit outside and pop and drink for an hour. 

&amp;#x200b;

**any suggestions on different ways? questions? additional helpful methods?** 

the first time i wanted to he knew about and told me please don't because he truly loves me. i'm not killing myself to get him back, i just can't take the pain that is caused my us.

&amp;#x200b;

thanks!

world doesn't need mei can't even figure out where to start. back in my junior year if high school i was hospitalized for major depression after i attempted suicide. a number of factors happened that year that caused me to do so. during my senior year of high school i flunked a math class that is preventing me from getting into a university. i was unemployed for a year until i found a shitty part time job at a sandwich shop. my hours are getting cut because i suck at it. i overheard my boss calling me incompetent after a co worker was trying to help me cut bread which i suck at. i'm probably gonna ask for a 2 week notice tomorrow. on top of that i want to apply to a community college but i'm scared i'll fuck up like i did in high school. most of my friends have left me except a few and i have zero chance with women. i promised myself i was going to buy a gun at 21 and conceal carry after my friend saw the knife attack at ohio state.

"it's too late to get the life i wantso i envisioned in myself a great life where i would be married go a lovely, beautiful, wife, have a few kids, live in a nice house and be at the top of my career game. 

now that seems all but impossible. i recently graduated with a civil engineering degree but i have no job lined up. i accrued internship experience like i was suppose to but no job at the end of the tunnel. i know i should've networked, i would do anything to go back and focus on networking and making a ton of friends in school. 

now this would be ok if i was 22 or even 24, but i'm not. i'm 27 years old. starting my career when i am 28 is far too late. i'm 4 years behind everyone else. 

on top of that i don't have as much experience with women as the average guy my age, just a couple girlfriends. most guys my age have had several fwb, as well as a couple **long term** gfs 

in my observation, most girls over the age of 22 are either taken, massive sluts, overweight, ugly, retarded, or mentally ill. many times it is a combination. on the other hand, feminists have created a stigma of ""older men"" dating younger women. no one is going to introduce their 20 year old friend to a 30 something year old man as a potential girlfriend. 

seriously the next time someone says something about age gaps and ""sick old men"" i will bash their baby's head into a wall and tell them this is what it's like to go through some real hardship bitch. i'll laugh and enjoy their sorrow and tell them it is just a splinter compared to the agony i face. 

luckily i just turned 27 so getting my career started at early 27 is fine but if i don't get started by the end of the summer i'm going to drown myself in a farmer irrigation lake. there's just no way i'm going to be able to live life on my terms. i'm deathly afraid of being alone but i'm also deathly afraid of marrying a ""reformed"" slut and getting divorce raped.

"first relapse in months, i need helpso. today i had my uni orientation. i plan on majoring in physics and german.

let's go back to several months ago. my dad had been in and out of our house over the past year and a half or so. more than several times he got drunk to the point of throwing/breaking things, threatening suicide in front of my sister, mom, and i. threatening divorce (the came real close to one) and moving because we had basically no money since my dad had been unemployed for about a year at this point. he is still looking for a job. money is tight and i have to pay for everything. stuff like that happening on and off every few months. guess who had to take her fucking placement exams during one of these episodes. me. well, today at orientation i was told that i cannot even enroll in calc 1 since my placement scores sucked bc i was stressed as fuck. again, wanting to major in physics. 

i have had a 3.95 uw gpa throughout high school, tons of ap classes interned for two summers at the chemistry dept at my uni, interned for the physics dept, for a semester, started a science club, good sat scores, especially considering my situation. hell, i got an a in ap calc ab both semesters; i can do the work.

now my entire fucking life is ruined because i can't take calc 1 because i sucked at one standardized test on one day when i've done great the rest of the time. i can't take physics without calc. physics is my passion, without majoring in something i love and have been planning for all this time, then why live all?

just when i was thinking that all the hard work that i've done actually payed off, this happens.

the academic advisor scheduled an appointment with a math dept. consultant tomorrow morning. i can retake the placement test and possibly a calc exam, but there's only a month before classes begin and i leave soon for a week trip to see my grandma. plus, no matter what i say or show the math dept. person, they'll think it's bs. they'll think i'm making excuses and shit, i'm sure they've heard it all. to them it's a dumb sob story, but to me it's been my life. i try not to make this shit public too, like it's so personal and i absolutely despise talking about it; i'm in denial of my family's past problems. i try to forget it. and i did for most of the summer, until now.

so now my entire life plan and passions are ruined and now i wanna cut myself again and i am thinking about suicide again.

what the hell do i do? we are supposed to sign up for classes tomorrow. this fucks up my whole major and 4 yr plan. i'm in an absolute state of panic and kinda just wanna get in a car crash on the way there or cut too deep.

"really wanna give up just scared to.it's so hard to keep going. the only reason i don't is because i don't wanna survive by accident and be locked up in a mental hospital..... then i'd have to pretend to be better to try again. another reason is that i partially fear what comes next. i'm not a believer in god's or after life i've always been an atheist but, what if their right. 

&amp;#x200b;

i don't really care about hurting anyone with my death mainly because i'm gonna be dead so who cares also, it's not like i'm gonna be missed. 

19 yrs old, never been in a relationship or really cared about anyone and, worst of all i'm a high school dropout from my senior year. i've got most of my credits just like a couple left. i just lost all will to finish. i don't know, i've always tried my best to be a normal person, never been in jail or done any crime for that matter. not even smoked weed even though it seems like every one is. 

&amp;#x200b;

a psychiatrist? i don't trust anyone with my family past, and really opening up is what helps but, if i can't why do it? just be a waste of money and i don't wanna cause anymore weight on my mother. she already doesn't like me as much as it is. 

&amp;#x200b;

i don't even know why, i would've thought she would at least treat me like the rest of my siblings because i've been though most of our struggle with her.

&amp;#x200b;

gonna go back a little bit to explain. my father was always very controlling. when he didn't get his way he would get really angry, he mostly take it out on my mother. he always stole my mother's pills for her back pain and, these pills were high end stuff. i'm telling you this stuff could put down a horse (a little over exaggeration). so her doc's would only give her a little bit a month. when she tried to stop him, he would just take them forcefully. 

&amp;#x200b;

when i got older and was able to stand up to him, (mind you he was no little guy) there was finally a little balance in the family. we couldn't just leave him cause he made the money, so that means i had to keep him in check when they would argue or he doesn't get his way. i had to fight my father and that doesn't really do well mentally for a teen needing a figure. 

&amp;#x200b;

the only time he really sent me over the edge was when he destroyed my laptop. my laptop was the only thing that brought me happiness. i watched anime, and gamed on it. so when he destroyed it i fought him and lost. looking back i wish i was thinking during the fight, i was just blindly throwing fists and wasn't doing so well.

&amp;#x200b;

i never forgave him for breaking my only happiness, i couldn't just go get another one we weren't rolling in money so i took care of my laptop like i did with any gift i got from my mother. 

&amp;#x200b;

my childhood was always stressful and, eventually i didn't even care to make friends since we were always moving. my siblings originally thought i was the bad guy because i fought our dad. they only recently realized the truth. so even my brothers and sister weren't my friends. it was hard growing up being the bad guy.  

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

eventually my mother became able to support us on her own so we left him almost a year ago, i also had to convince her to leave him because she.....i can only describe it as stockholm syndrome. except he wasn't actually a good guy like in movies.  

&amp;#x200b;

now even with him out of the picture i'm still under fire. i think my mother blames me for their breakup and i'm treated differently from my siblings. i'm always the reason for anything that goes wrong now. kinda scared that my mother will go back to him because she wants to.....and waste all my struggling for a life away from him.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm really to the point that when i see a cliff it's almost to tempting. 

&amp;#x200b;

now that you're caught up. any thoughts? questions? 

thanks for reading i kinda just needed to vent a bit in hopes someone will read this. sorry for the long post.

"happy suicide?i've been thinking about suicide for a while now, but i honestly have no idea. i have a pretty good life, and i'd say i'm happy the majority of my time. i'm a happy person with a happy life, or so i thought... especially the last 2 weeks, i've been thinking of just ending it, and i'm feeling more confused by the day.

when i'm busy and actively doing stuff, i'm fine, but it seems the moment i have free time, something just clicks. i feel lonely, sad, uninspired and overall depressed.

any suggestions to get back into life/advice? i know talking to people is often the obvious solution, but i've always been really against trusting people, and i am very stubborn at being an individual.",suicide,suicide,1.0

now this pain haunts me and now anytime i hear the word “rape“ or hear anyone getting close to being raped my heart starts beating and my blood just starts to boil, i just wanna get this off my chest because i know if i let it cling to me it would cause more damage then it initially did....

"hello therei'm just here to admit, to at least someone in this world, my feelings these past few weeks. i've been struggling a lot but that's not a surprise to me or anyone really.

i feel so trapped by my body because it's just so heavy sometimes and because my mind is as slow as if it were stuck in tar.

i keep having these dreams where i try to kill myself and i keep trying to fall back to sleep to revisit that wonderful relief i guess.

i hate being alive because it's so suffocating and i have just been in misery the past few weeks. in retrospect that doesn't sound so bad, but considering that this pattern repeats itself i guess it makes sense.

i haven't been able to talk to my friends and even talking to some of them trigger my depressing feelings or wanting to sh. it's awful and so hard to navigate interactions with people.
ive just been in so much pain i really want to die.

i'm using what little energy i have to admit that i hate myself. i don't believe i am redeemable. i don't think i could even live a good life if i were to become happy  because i am still flawed and disgusting. i make other's lives hard and sad. esspecially my family...
i'm so smart and gifted and i will be going to college soon but i really don't see how anything could make things better for me.

"a title with more effort than last time  

as a sophomore in highschool, i genuinely enjoy my classes have fun in most of them even if i'm online. most are either fairly easy or the work is fun to do. but there's one class that has actually driven school from being actually fun to being fucking hell. world history ap, worst mistake i've ever been was listening to my world geo teachers advice in actually taking the class. there is... so much i can rant about her and how shitty of a teacher she is but i'll try to split it up to the best of my ability.

~~sorry for grammar mistakes, english is my first language but i'm kind of stupid.~~

the teacher seems nice, though that might be because its the only good trait she has, that she can put on a smile despite most of her class failing. though its not an uncommon problem, at this point it just feels like she's doing it on purpose. she constantly has technical difficulties, always having to resubmit or modify something mid class. this isn't unusual, especially since i'm her 2nd period. though, its getting out of hand. more than 3 or 4 months into the school year she still has problems that makes us have less than ten minutes for a twenty to thirty question quiz. this has happened multiple times and you have to be immensely lucky to actually be able to finish it. not only that, but even with her technical difficulties she doesn't give us more time. and whenever there's a problem she doesn't accept that there is a problem until at least half of the class has complained about it. it makes the whole process of her fixing her mistakes that much longer.

she blatantly tells the class whenever someone failed a quiz or a test. though she doesn't outright say it, she basically has a line that we have all accepted as 'they failed'. she says 'did you study', which most people say they did because we did. but its just getting absurd how much she just asks most kids in the class if they studied and i just don't see what's the point giving out this information to the public even if it isn't 'obvious' that she is.

i go to her classes every day, i do all of the work. not once has she told us how to actually study for her class. what she does instead is give us a huge online text book then give us 40 - 60 pages (a whole chapter) to read and figure out what important info we need. she doesn't give us hints or information on what we need to make sure to make notes on or anything, we have to completely figure this out by ourselves. she doesn't even show us her copy of the notes until the day before a major test. meaning we have to go over her notes which are usually 2 documents with 90 pages in one night and study that. i understand ap is a college level class, but it gives so much unnecessary work that we'll get wrong anyways because its almost fate that you'll forget to note down enough things from the text book that you fail the tests.

i've emailed her multiple times about my problems, believe me that was one of the first things i did. but a few weeks ago i had a schedule problem and was set as face to face instead of virtual which i wasn't told about until thursday of that week. so i missed out on almost a whole week of work. so i emailed her on how i can catch up since it was the beginning of the fucking nine weeks and my grade was a 12 in the class because of that. its been two weeks since then and i sent her three emails. not a single one has been answered. i've tried to leave the class multiple times but i can't until the first semester is over (so i have to be in it until january).

this class genuinely gives me anxiety and panic attacks. even thinking about the class puts me in a panic out of nowhere. i know its effecting my mental health when i straight up have a panic attack when i even think about the class coming up or the next quiz. its not natural, even on the hard classes i've had before i genuinely have never panicked out of nowhere about a class.

"losing everything that mattersi’ve been unhappy for a long time. i’ve never been “well” ever. i grew up in a pretty bad home situation and my young adult life had other traumatic experiences i was never able to deal with . i met someone, and felt like i had a shot at a normal life, normal relationship, normal family, normal job. we have a beautiful flat in a quiet neighbourhood that we put a lot of time into decorating together. shopping for groceries together and cooking meals together and looking at dogs and houses with fences for dogs. i didn’t have a real meltdown for 3 years. everything i wanted-stability, normal.

hes left to his parents. he’s tired of me being too emotional and not making as much salary as he does. i lack ambition.  


i need to be out of our place in a couple weeks. i don’t have family or friends to fall back on. i’m losing his family too. i’m supposed to start at a new job too so there won’t be a paycheque for 4 weeks. i have a lot o debt, and i can’t afford more than half a rent alone. i don’t have enough to cover a new lease anyway even with roommates. i’m terrified of living with a stranger. i’m terrified of going to a shelter.  i looked at one place that had a shared bathroom and there was black stuff all over the floor and it was still too expensive for me.  he won’t speak to me on the phone, i’ve been living in our place by myself. he’s taking our cat, which really hurts because i’ve had her for 8 years and she’s probably the only being who still loves me but it’s not fair to her if i can’t provide adequate food and home.

thursday night he had me sent to psych emerg. they showed up with 3 police cars and all the neighbours came outside and then i had to sit and cry in a public hall way because there were no beds and they told me if i ran away i’d be arrested, it was completely humiliating.

when i got out on friday night i realized he did it so that i’d be out of the house so he could come pick up more of his things. i’ve been taking sleeping pills since that and only get up for the bathroom. 


i don’t understand how you can love someone for three years and build a life together and then cancel it.


i just don’t see a way out of this. the public mental health options weren’t helpful.  i’m scared of death but my life feels like a mean joke right now and i don’t see how it can improve.

"talking to myselfdo you guys talk to yourselves? 

recently  whenever  i can't  sleep  i start to think my situation  and how fucked up i am, i talk to myself  like telling  how hard is my situation, how hard is to be depressed  with anxiety  and how wonderful  will be sleep  like a normal person  and have energy to do all the stuff  i need and want to do.

is like: ""damn it man, i want to sleep  but  i can't, do i need to take drugs to be able to sleep? i mean, i don't  want to be codependent on this things, what if someday  i'm not able to pay for it? what if someday  just make it worse? well maybe that's  the only option  i have, even though i have been avoiding  it...""

"doomedi can’t remember the last time i lived without depression or anxiety. for a few months, i did manage to ‘forget’ my depression and thought i was on the mend. but the last few months have been really hard and i really feel like my last hope has been sealed shut and i’m ready to give up.

i grew up in a good house with good parents. i don’t know what happened to me. when i was very young, 10 or 11, i developed crippling anxiety. it first started with feeling sick. i would then be equally terrified of actually being sick and where i was/who would see. i did not know that what i was really having were panic attacks and what anxiety was until much later. not long after this started, i began to fear losing people close to me, like my parents and grandparents. no one died or was ill, i just was so worried. it consumed my thoughts and i ended up sleeping in my parents room for 6 months because i was worried they would die in their sleep. this is where the rest of my mental illness stops making sense. i fell apart and into a deep depression. i was completely perfect on the outside though. i could never let anyone know. i attempted several times in high school, but again, hid it all. as an adult, i’ve tried treatment but didn’t feel any relief. 

now, i still see no end. i am anxious the entire day. losing my family terrifies me more now than ever before. often i wish they all would have died in childhood so i would be in recovery at this stage. all i want is something to wipe away every trace of me. i want to be alone. just so alone. i would actually just do this, but i couldn’t knowing who i left behind. i would just decide to wait until my family dies so they don’t know, but that’s still so long and i don’t want to keep going on with the loml. we’ve been together for a long time so he knows some. i just hate making any memory because i know that one day i will inevitably lose him one way or the other. i absolutely do not want that. he is my family too, so of course i also have worry terribly about him dying too. 

interestingly, i’m also fascinated with death in the likes of forensic files, cold case files, etc. it seems very hypocritical to me and all i can sum it up to is that i fear it so i want to better understand it/lessen its power.

there’s much more to it but basically i’m just trying to find a way to go as silently as possible. all i can console myself with is that once i’m dead, i won’t even know about it. i’ll just be nothing. that makes me the worst person, i know, but again, it’s just inevitable.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i am 21, never had a job, not in college, in an unstable long-term relationship with someone who does not deserve my bullshit, living with (and semi taking care of) half-sibling &amp; mother, a cat, and a chihuahua. fuck me with a sack of grainy half-formed bricks.

i'm tired of sleeping during the day and staying up all night, i'm tired of clothes that don't fit. i'm tired of having to pay $50 to wash a week's worth of laundry, because we're too poor to afford a washing machine, and fixing the current one would cost more than buying a used one.

i'm tired of not having enough food to eat, and not being able to eat things that are good for me because they are too expensive. fucking bullshit, in this day and age i should be able to buy a motherfucking apple for less than a dollar.

i want some fucking clean clothes argh fuck you washing machine goddamn i miss you. didn't know how good i had it with a leaky ass washing machine. washing panties in the shower is oddly not as bad as i thought it would be. but fuck me if it doesn't take valuable time to do it.

i'm really fucking tired of my friends, who do have legitimate problems (every problem is worthy of attention, to me) but cannot be assed to actually do anything about it. my best girl friend is bipolar as shit and a stage 5 clinger, who i used to baby a lot. bad idea, i know. she finds no joy in anything and cries about things constantly to me. she has so many good things going for her, yet she will cry for days if someone says ""fuck"" in front of her, or mentions anything even slightly nsfw. yet she finds no problems in making dirty jokes on her own terms. hypocritical bitch. i can't vent or talk about my problems with her because she immediately turns it into a pity party for her. suck a dick, you might learn something. my other best friend is much more tolerable but still annoying as fuck at times. his only real problem is his foreveralone attitude. otherwise he's perfectly capable of anything. oh, and he's gay in bumfuck, deep south. that sucks. i can't vent to him because he is a notorious ""shit, someone's got a problem, vacate premises immediately"" kind of guy. he's gotten better about it, but once he feels he's right, he refuses to back down. his solution is the only solution.

i'm tired of living here, of having been born into such a fucking dysfunctional cesspit of used douches. my brother raped me on multiple occasions when i was only a child, 8 if i remember correctly, and would beat me to the point of unconsciousness since i was 4  (up until 13, whereupon he finally left the nest); my mother would just tell me to fight back. praytell, mother, how a very small and malnourished girl would fight against a 6', 340lb teenage boy? goddamned cunt. (sidenote: she did not know of the rape at the time, and still doesn't.) i hope he dies in a fucking fire. i mean that literally, a fire that fucks him. that would make me laugh in the darkest part of my soul.

i was homeschooled from the age of 7. what little social interaction i've ever had has been with people significantly younger than i, or significantly older than i. as a result, i have never mingled with my own generation. turns out, they're all (mostly) cunts and unintelligent fucks. being as i was completely sheltered, i am socially and in all other ways totally inept. i am socially retarded in the highest degree, i am awkward and unable to function in public; most people, after having known me a bit, have confessed that they thought i had down's or some other mental disease which makes you look like a textbook idiot.

my fiancee and i lack communication. i cannot vent to him, because when i try, i am usually upset and unable to word things correctly, and evidently that sounds like too much bitching, so he shuts down and attempts robotic comfort. that just frustrates me so i internalize every goddamned thing that i need to get out. i have explained my two best friends; the female friend hates my fiancee, even though he has been a picture of nicety and kindness to her. i'm guessing this is because he cuts into her [my name]-time. the male friend is more concerned with making pseudo-jokes about wanting to buttfuck my fiancee. that shit was funny maybe once. maybe. shit isn't fucking funny now. cut that out.

current living situation is me caring for my terminally ill half-brother and mother. mother is supposed to be dead, no one knows why the bitch is still kicking. hoping she gets better so i can get the fuck out of here, if not, i am stuck here forever. she refuses to make meals if i am in anyway unable to. even just for herself. my half-brother is tube-fed, so she takes care of that, and i take care of her. 

i am not sure where i was going with this. i stopped crying and got exhausted by the time i got this far. fuck. uh. i'm probably not going to kill myself, as that would be certain death for my family, but i still have that *shit man dying would just be so fuckin easy yeah just do it you won't be around to give a fuck about the consequences* thought knocking around. and most days, i feel my cat is the only one worth living for. little fucker's been with me through some rough shit. oh goddamnit now i'm crying again.

if you need more info/background or some shit, just ask. never done this before (spilling my blood and guts before the glorious internet), feeling anxious as fuck and not knowing what the hell to do makes it even worse. i would hug the shit outta you guys if i could, just for reading this massive textwall. i feel a bit better getting some of this out, but i still feel like the rocket of spicy liquid magma that gets shot out of someone's ass after they've eaten good mexican food.

my dad's slowly gone through his whole life's savings to pay for my college. he gave me $17,000 for a graduation gift, and i was an idiot and spent it on frivolous shit (apartment, xbox, clothes) instead of saving it. i have one year left and he's out of money. i already took out a federal loan for last year ($7,500) and i've already had multiple anxiety attacks over repaying it. if i was a good person i'd just take out another loan, but i'm not a good person, so i didn't.

my fiance has offered to take a loan out in his name to pay for my college and build up his own credit. it's an incredibly selfless thing to do but it just makes me feel guilty. every time somebody does something to help me, it just makes me feel guilty. the guilt's caused me physical pain, it's just too much.

"an unfortunate end of a forgettable soulits a long one.
i guess this is it, huh.
long story short: 20y.o failing university for the second time in a row (i still haven't passed the exams from last semester), lying in bed, feeling empty and wishing for it to end.
i am a jumble of conflicting feelings, tbh. i dont want to live - that much is obvious, i guess - my existence has dragged on for long enough for me to become a big nuisance to my family. i dont have the will in me to continue, and i would never admit to my family that i have been depressed for nearly ten years now. its not only that i dont trust them (i don't - not when it counts), but i don't want to impose my damage on them. they have done everything in their power to help me settle in this life - and i am going to fuck it up yet again.
i am a failure( that much is obvious) and i have no one to blame but myself. worse - a parasite, that have been sucking resources from those who need it more. the hatred and loathing i feel towards myself is immense, but it dulled over the years.
i have tried - not very vigorously, i have to admit - to find a job and keep up with my studies, to lead that goddamn adult life that everyone seemed to grab a hold onto much faster than me. but i don't function like everyone else. i am too expendable to be noticed by anyone, with no interesting personality to show or particular skill set to demonstrate. every rejection,, be it job application or a friend proposal, every little mistake stung, but not like 'oh, well, i should learn something from it and just go on trying'. it served as a proof of my incompatibility to life itself, as if everything that i try to do leads to nothing, like i am trying to break through a concrete wall with only the force of my fists.
 i am not stupid, but not nearly as smart as my parents. i do lack a lot in social interactions, especially stressful ones or where i am at risk making a fool out of myself. i would avoid them at all cost, with little to no explanation other than 'what if those people would laugh at my stupidity and think i am an idiot?'
but i am also a coward, because i have been meaning to end it all for years, and i should have done it three years ago, before i went to uni.
and yet, i feel calm, somehow. the thought of death doesn't scare me nearly as much as it should, rather a thought of me somehow fucking things up and surviving. i dont want to feel pain, and i know there is no painless method of suicide.
 i am not yet fully ready to commit, my mind finds distractions in cleaning my stuff and deleting all information from my pc and phone. maybe i am second-guessing myself. maybe i am even more of a coward than i thought. maybe all this calm is akin to compartmentalization, and i am just fooling myself into thinking i am fine with it.
i have already done all the preparations with the method of my choice (thats a first - before that it never got to buying a rope), but i got spooked by my roommate, so for now i am waiting for them to leave.

"why is no one interested in me i've really been trying to maintain friendships but it's hard now. making/maintaining friends were so much easier before. i don't have any friends except my family. my family members are great friends, but i still need friends outside of family. no one talks to me on discord, snapchat or instagram. i have no one in my instagram in dms (like literally nobody). i've always noticed that i always tend to get pretty close to someone, and they just stop talking to me. as if i don't exist. this has happened 3-4 times. i always have to text first to even have a chance of talking to somebody, and even then they usually don't respond. i really hope that this changes next year in grade 10. in grade 10 i really want meet like a smoking hot girl, that's in my grade,who is really interested in me. someone who will text me first (not all the time), and is interesting and fun to talk to as fuck. someone who will stay up and talk to me late at night. someone who has a special nickname for me. someone who would roast the fuck out of anybody who'd bully me. someone who'd always say something like ""hey wanna go get starbucks"" but yeah, i'm really hoping to make some friends soon, especially in grade 10.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0
"i’m going to kill myself on halloweeni have struggled for years and years with depression, anxiety, self harm, ptsd and suicide. i lost my teenage years to mental illness and i hate it. 

i’ve had three attempts at ending my life but obviously they didn’t work.. i ended up being hospitalised for one of them and i really hope i don’t fuck up with this one and fail because there’s absolutely no way i’m going back to a hospital.

i’ve been thinking about it for quite some time on when i’m going to do it, and last week i got some rope and new blades and decided i’m doing it on the 31st. in the early hours of the morning i’m going to get up and drive to the tallest bridge in my state and hang myself. it’s been closed for years, but people still go check it out even though it’s illegal. 

i have everything planned out. i have my notes written out to my family and roommate and i have special instructions for one of my family members on what to do with my belongings. 

i don’t know if this is weird to say, but i’m kind of excited for saturday. i finally get relief after all these years. no more pain. no more sadness. no more terrible withdrawals from drug use. it’ll be all gone. i feel a sense of calmness for once in my life.

i don't even know where to begin and i'm typing all this on my phone. i'm terrible with words and i hate that language is the only way i know to express myself because i'm so bad at it, and i keep thinking how unfair it is that i cant find the words to explain the alterity of my problems and how at the end of the day all the thoughts and ideas and convictions i possess are just words but i'll give it a shot.
my depression has taking many stages and i'm at the point where i think i have my faults boiled down to a few points. i don't handle the truth well(i'm trying my hardest to be brutally honest here), i'm lazy, i get too anxious for no reason, and i'm a sexual deviant. of course there are many more but those three things are holding me back so much, and i'd love to just blow my brains out and be done with it. i've come close several times, most recently last week where, in a fit of rage and anxiety, i tied a noose around my neck. unfortunately, or fortunately, i couldn't find a place to support myself and the rope in my apartment. as i'm typing this i'm finding it extremely difficult to find a flow to all of this, as what i'm trying to say spans my whole life so please bear with me.
i guess i'll start with why i feel like i can't just end it all. that reason is my loved ones, and there are quite a few. mainly though, above all my friends and family, its my parents. if only they knew how their love has kept me here. they care about me so much, have invested so much into me and my future, not only would they be completely devastated (my mom might actually become suicidal herself if i went through it), but i can't help but feel like i'm spitting in their faces if i did it. its such a paradox to me, i feel like such a failure and it kills me inside to know how much they love me, but i can't do it because i can't let go of the fact at how it would affect those around me. which brings me to the dilemma of whether i actually appreciate that love enough not to go through with it, or if its just something i'm clinging to at this point. that i want to believe i actually care enough about how they would feel if i killed myself. i want to believe a lot of things, that i'm a good loving person but is has becoming increasingly clear that that is not the case. to me at least. i'm not sure if this shows how ungrateful i am, but sometimes i wish i didn't have so many people who care about me, it would make it so much easier. then again i think about all the people who don't have someone to love or who loves them back, and i wonder if they would trade places? i've been lying to my parents everyday for the last two months. they think i'm still in school, i dropped out.


i know i'm somewhat intelligent, enough to know that i may not actually be intelligent and in fact, just a stupid fucking kid like i've always have been. i read quite a bit, (currently reading infinite jest which is kinda helping me/kinda not; why'd you have to kill yourself david?), i write sometimes, i can hold a discussion about almost anything. yet, i fucking suck at school, i guess i'm just accepting that its not for me, but that sounds like a cop out. my whole life i've been able to get by school without ever studying (literally k-12 i never spent more than 30 mins on school work), and i don't say that as some badge of honor, its so fucking stupid that i didn't study, but to illustrate the point that i felt like i was never challenged when the stakes didn't matter as much, and now in college where it does kinda matter, i'm suffering for it. and it just sucks. after high school i was accepted into my dream school to become a chef. when i told my family and friends, they were kinda unsupportive because they felt like it wasn't the right path for me and that i was wasting my mind, money, and time. when they posted schools that graduates were going to after high school, i had several teachers come up to me to try and convince me to go to a ""real"" school (i guess 50k tuition culinary school isn't ""real"" enough). in the end their advice wouldn't matter either way because i also suck at traditional college, but after one year of culinary school i dropped out because of financial and self confidence issues. then i decided to skip school to go directly to the kitchen, then i quit that too. mainly because i felt like i wanted a family and personal life more than wanting to become a chef; after working several years in kitchens, from shitty luncheons to michelin star restaurants in manhattan, i realized i couldn't have either.


so 3 years after high school i wanted to try my hand at a university. so i applied to one school and they accepted me and i went. at first i started studying business administration because i thought maybe i'd want to own my own business one day, then recently i changed to a double major in information science and cognitive science with a focus in data analysis. big change right? it was just another thing i was interested in. i came to admire several of my professors. my goal changed from becoming a successful chef, to wanting to become like them. having such a depth of knowledge where you're able to just teach it to someone in a way that not only made it palatable, but also enjoying. to recall all that information on a whim and love a subject so much was something i was interested in. i quickly began to realize that i don't have what it takes to do that, or i'm afraid of at least trying because i doubt myself too much. its just that there is so much to learn out there, and as soon as i try one thing, i become quickly distracted by another. i'd rather program and code at my own pace and time rather than have deadlines, one minute i could be interested in reading the problems with big data and privacy concerns and the next i'd rather read about how julius caesar launched a brilliant campaign in britannia. i have little focus or motivation to do the things i'm ""supposed"" to do.


this is where things get a little murky and hard to explain. so, my first year at school, when i was studying business administration, i just stopped going to class during the second semester. i had little to no motivation as i was finding it harder to cope with the fact that there is so meaning to life. (i've since come to terms with that and realized life isn't supposed to have a point, its up to you to make or find it.) it was hard for me to rationalize anything i was doing anymore, as i was working towards nothing that i actually wanted. i had no reason to really push myself other than my family. their love was enough for me to stop myself from jumping off a bridge, but not enough to motivate me to succeed at anything. on top of that i began having anxiety attacks in the middle of class. i started talking to a school psychologist to help me through. at first she totally did help, i felt like it was best to take a medical withdrawal, recharge my batteries after the summer with friends, then go back to school. i did that and it kinda worked for a little. i was doing pretty okay, then the depression and anxiety came swinging back. i just barely passed my classes and at the end of the semester i had to write a letter to the school convincing them that my 2. whatever gpa wasn't indicative of what i was really capable of. i again recharged my batteries over the winter break and came back to school with renewed focus and changed my major. then she happened.


there this girl, let's call her m. i knew this girl before this last semester. this story begins during my first year of school. when i first saw her, it was my usual thoughts of ""oh she's kinda pretty and interesting, i wonder if she'll be my friend/girlfriend/get married/have kids/die together."" i've had girls before that i liked a lot that didn't reciprocate, girlfriends who i thought i loved but actually didn't, one night stands that left me feeling kinda empty. but this girl, m, she was so different. like i said i was just my usual level of curious when i met her. we coincidentally became friends over a cigarette with mutual friends. as time went on and i hung out with her, i became more and more infatuated but never to the point where i felt like it was okay to act on those feelings. i remember being at a party, my friend and beer pong partner had gotten very drunk and became belligerent with our opponents. after the game i heard he went outside and was starting to get rowdy with those same kids, so i started to rush to his aid. m stopped me on my way out. (god with that tight black dress, long red hair that smelled like ginger and flowers). she asked what was wrong and as i was explaining she stopped me, got on her toes to whisper in my ear""everything will be okay"", and kissed me. man oh man did i want to believe her, i think for a moment i kinda did. (this part reads like a shitty romance, its not)


nothing really happened between us after that, we were both kinda drunk. anyway, more time went on and we started flirting and hanging out more but never really acting on it. the main reason, at least for me, was because of my friend and roommate. let's call him e. e is very very smart. way more intelligent than i, but he's not the best looking guy. overweight, acne, long greasy hair. but obviously he's more than just his surface and i quickly realized how much we had in common. anyway, i came to realize, and eventually confirm, that e had a deep crush on m as well. he would hang out a lot with her too. i was not in the least bit threatened or jealous or anything. she wasn't at all interested (she told me she wasn't when he professed his love for her for the fourth time), but i did feel bad. i especially felt bad with the way she treated him. she would openly flirt with me in front of him, ask him for favors that she knew he would do because he loved her, and honestly it was kinda shitty. in fact, i started liking m less and less, to the point where i almost hated her. anyway, this is about the time where the first semester of my second year was ending. right before i changed majors. when i came back to school thinking i was no longer interested in m, we started hanging out more. like every single day, and again i felt bad because e would have to come home sometimes to find us snuggling and giggling on the couch. i hated that, it kinda caused me to say and do stupid things to m in front of e to appear more distant. we only hooked up once and both agreed that it was just a mistake made by horny college kids. we had a close circle of friends and we didn't want to make it awkward, especially with e. in reality, i definitely didn't feel the same and i wish i told her then. fast forward a couple of months and she's done with school but still living near me. she would still hang out every day with me and it got to the point where i was anxious to just skip class and be with her. i knew our time was dwindling as she was going to move back home. i decided to come clean with her and tell her how i felt. going back to one of my main problems, i got so anxious and botched it up completely. the words just couldn't come out the right way and i think we kind of got into a fight. she was mad that i was laying this all on her now when she's leaving, and that she couldn't possibly be in a relationship with me because of the distance and she wasn't ready. (she has her own list of problems, anxiety, depression, attempted suicide over an ex etc)


right before she left we kinda patched things up but i knew things were never going to be the same. the day she left i walked by her apartment on the way home from class, and i cried a little. i felt like i was never going to see her again. the thing is i think she was, or is, the only girl i ever really loved. she made me laugh (which is hard, i don't really find much of anything funny anymore, and i take pride in my sense of humor as its one of the main ways i make friends), she gave me reason to do things. to improve myself, (i should mention that i'm not the most in shape guy. in fact, before i started that second year i was so disgusted by my weight that i dropped 80 pounds) to want to succeed. i should also mention that about two months prior i took my first trip on mushrooms. i came to several realizations while on it, one of them being that no matter what happened everything was going to be okay if i had her in my life. all i wanted to do while tripping was be with her and explain every detail of my love for her. of course that never happened. when she left i stopped going to class, i had lost that one thing that kept me going in any sense. i don't blame her at all, its really my fault that i even put myself in that kind of position. i just crashed and have been falling ever since.


i was supposed to go the a buddy's cabin for his bday a couple weeks ago and she was going as well. until she texted me and told me she met someone and that he was also going to be there. she wanted to give me a warning and not ""blindside"" me. i'll be honest, it made me feel like shit. like all that other stuff she said about not wanting to be in a relationship was just an excuse. a couple days ago she texted me again. randomly, about an inside joke where one day, on our way out from the thrift shop(she was making my halloween costume), i was in my car behind a row of cars in front of a light. the light changed several times and we were both like what the hell. i started to honk, but finally i realized there was no one in any of the cars in front of us. they were parked...it was a small street. we both just started cracking up for a solid five minutes in the car and always mentioned this story when we wanted the other to feel stupid. anyway, she asks if i remember that happened (of course i fucking do). then she asked if she could start hanging out with me over the summer since she just got her license; not unless though i ""hated her"". i became so mad, i didn't want to hang out with her so i could get over it, but i wanted to see her so bad. i wanted to tell her, yea, in fact i do hate you so she would stay away but i also didn't want to seem like some prissy teenager. i punched a hole in my wall and tried hanging myself that night. i realize how bad that is...


that was way longer than i expected but that was just one part of the problems i'm dealing with and felt that it was necessary to try and make anyone understand why i'm writing this shit in the first place. this is where things get bad. this is the one thing, that even if suddenly all my other problems were magically solved, i would still want to kill myself. as i mentioned, i'm a sexual deviant. in other words, i'm attracted to younger girls. way too young. and i realize this is wrong on every level, and while i never acted out on those desires i live in shame of it. i can't talk to anyone about it because its disgusting, and would completely alter everyone's perception of me. i struggle with this, and the worst part is, one of the things i wanted most in life is a family. but how could i if i have these attractions? it makes me so sick, and everyone tells me how good i am with kids i just want to throw up typing this. i've tried so much to change or put those thoughts out of my mind but i keep relapsing. obviously im attracted to other women, my own age, older women, all of them. i don't think i can ever fix this one attraction thoigh which is why i want to end my life. i think its the only way.


beyond that though my problems have become more existential. i find it difficult to sleep, getting maybe an average of 3-5 hours of sleep a day. i find it difficult to get out of bed every day, covering my head hoping that when i emerge i will be somewhere completely different. i be been struggling a lot with, how everything exists together and its all connected, how maybe it doesn't even exist, is this a simulation, does the answer even matter, religion( my dad is super catholic but i never cared for it), and the idea of free will. how we aren't actually free to do what we want and we're just like a computer, programmed from birth and recompiled with our experiences. how that is the way we make decisions. i'm leaving a lot out (how i feel about western civilization and capatlism, my friends, specific famiky members, my childhood, its all connected) as this is getting pretty lengthy, my phone is about to die, i don't want to proof read all of this, and honestly i'm not sure how to tie it all together.
if you haven't realized by now, i'm desperate. i need someone to tell me everything will be okay like m did at that party. idk if that sounds stupid because people tell me that all the time. i've had an innumerable amount of conversations about life where people try and impart some wisdom or knowledge, but it allbseems kinda...i don't know the word, useless? i realize how beautiful life is but its a process, a grind. i no longer want to be involved in that process, but i can't die. i just hope one day a bus driver falls asleep for a second at the wheel and hits me. or maybe if i just walk in front of it. its 5 am, i'll read this tomorrow. i apologize in advance for my terrible writing, grammar, and overall bitchiness",suicide,suicide,1.0

"(rant) just about tired!i’m just about tired of people telling me that i should get help for wanting to constantly commit suicide. about a year and a half ago, i saw a site that showed you the pain levels of certain suicide methods, and how long it takes to kill your self with said method. that page had long been since removed from google search, but when i try to find the page again, all i’m given, is 

“please dial 1-800-273-8255 if you feel suicidal!”

“dont kill urself garblablablabla! there is hope!”

“go call the suicide hotline!!!!!1!!!!”

for the record, you don’t know me, you don’t know that i can barely get a job, you don’t know that i struggle in school, you don’t know my luck, you don’t know that i don’t have much to live for. with no friends and literally the worlds biggest loser. so stop saying that i should get help when all i’m trying to do, is follow through with plans that i had since i was 13.

- ""get some help""

i know but it might not be as easy as you think. i have been sexually assaulted by my ex, it was the worst thing in the world. it scared my life. the other reason why i feel this way is because of my parents. wow my parents the most amazing people in the world!! that is what most people would say. i have been verbally, emotionally and mentally scared after the things from 2019, i was expected to be more independent after my sister took all the attention away.

"why i want to not be here anymorethis probably isn’t the right place and i’m probably going to talk more then i should. i don’t really want to post this but there is a small part of me that i feel is making me post it.

i want to die and here is my story.

let’s start at the very start. or as far as i remember.

i was 3, my parents got married. one year later my mother started stealing from her work. she was fired. she found many more jobs where she continued to steal from. until one job didn’t just fire her. i was at home with mum. being like 4/5 years old and i hear a knock on the door. i open it even though she tells me not to. 3 men storm through the door one pins me down. while the other two beat and then rape my mum in front of me. this happens other 2 times, with week spaces. mum makes me keep quite and not tell dad. then she starts getting in people’s car while dad works, she doesn’t come back for about an hour. the tinted car just parks out front. they never drive anywhere. she comes back and has long showers. she then started gambling, uncontrollably. dad finds out when she steals his money. he comes home, they fight, mum punches dad, dad pushes her away and she falls through the front window. her face littered with glass, dad runs while mum bleeds out all over me. i call the police. i am 6 years old. we lose the house. we go broke. dad is extremely depressed and attempts suited many times but fails. mum becomes a prostitute and we find out she was cheating on dad. i live with dad. dad becomes schizophrenic but refuses to admit or realise it. for years, from my age 6 - 15 dad physically abused me. he did a lot of good, he always prioritised us (after weed, beer and cigarettes) and he worked 40-50 hour weeks for less then $1000 a week. we struggled. we ate 2 minute noodles, baked beans or weetbix for a lot of our meals. he only became angrier and angrier until i could take it anymore. he has physically hurt me my whole life, and mentally abused me for years. i once damaged a couch that belonged to a girl that he was talking to. he came home. threw me on the ground, punched and kicked me. spat on me. dragged me by my hair to my room. then locked me there for 7 days with one meal a day. he often told me he doesn’t love me and wished i wasn’t born. i got older and stronger. at 16 i met the love of my life. let’s call her t. at first i wasn’t sure. i thought it my just be my hormones but for sure after a while i realised how deeply i loved her. she got kicked out due to family arguements. she’s a good girl. it wasn’t her fault. she stayed with me, dad and my brother and sister. dad didn’t like this and one day snapped at me. following me. telling me to hit him. he slammed my head against a wall. i lost it. i went into some kind of crazy rage. like all that had happened built up and i was releasing it. i was ready to kill him but t stopped me. we moved out to my grandparents and called the police. he received no charges. by this point my mother had moved to state after not having anything to do with us for years. eventually t and i got our own house. we were both 17 working 35 hours a week and doing year 12 at the same time. it was extremely stressful. our relationship went a bit bitter. we enjoyed each other’s company less. she left me twice over little arguments. eventually i grew tired of being played with and left. after 3 months i realised how much i couldn’t bare without her. i tried to fix things with her. she told me she didn’t want to. she asked me to stay over a few times so i did. we didn’t have any kind of sexual activity. i just wanted to be with and around her. i was so in love. losing her made me love her more then ever. she told me she loved me, she always wanted me around. we went out together many many times. and then we get to today. the reason i’m writing this. i wonder if anyone even made it this far. she tells me she doesn’t want to be together and that she’s got feelings for another man. now i don’t want to seem dramatic, but this girl is all i had. all i cared for. my self worth is non existent. and after opening up to her, i had devoted myself to her. after all these years of hurt. 19 years of pain. i can’t take it anymore. i feel like i needed to get this out. but i honestly want to die. i welcome the thought of suicide. i don’t even care how painful it is. it’s less painful then living my life of constant loss and stress. also about 3 months ago i lost my job and my car. i’m in debt with rent and behind in all my bills. my landlord wants to evict me and i don’t have any family to live with anymore. i want to just leave this world. i know what people say. just wait until this passes but i can’t wait anymore. i’ve been waiting my whole life. yes i thought about the people around me and the impact on those very very few people, i don’t care if i get called selfish. i’m thinking about me right now and the pain i’m in. i’ve seen psychologists and councilor’s my whole life. nothing helps. i don’t even know why i’m posting this. i’m not even asking for advice. i just want to feel lighter in the head when i pass on. if you read all this. thank you. i didn’t write everything that’s happened because writing all this was hard enough.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"scared myself todayi'm a 20 year old who lives a decent life, is attending college, and just started a new job as a bank teller. i don't really want to die but i have struggled with suicidal ideation since i was in elementary school. often, when i have an episode of depression i ponder all the ways i could end it which bums we out even more. i'm also on the autism spectrum so i have a hard time managing my emotions and expressing them to other people. i also have serious social anxiety and have a hard time engaging in meaningful conversations and forming/maintaining new relationships. i don't cut, but i have hurt myself in impulsive rage. none of my friends or family seem to fully understand the extent of emotional pain i am in on a daily basis. my mother is long dead, my relationship with my father doesn't exist, and my stepmother is a toxic and unreasonable alcoholic. the only person in my household i can connect with is my younger brother, but he is going away to college leaving me in a toxic cesspool that is my household. 

most days i have to force myself to study or do homework which i often procrastinate on. i don't even do anything else to fill the time. i just scroll through reddit on my phone and rack up the screen time. sometimes i just curl up on the bed with the shades down and wallow is self pity. only recent i have made an effort to stop self medicating with weed which has helped but not by much. also for ten years i had an abusive friend who was manipulative and often criticized me for my social performance. he acted like a crazy, possessive girlfriend and would force me to go to parties and inform me of all the shit people would say about me. on night he even went on a tirade at me and predicted that i would one day kill myself. my other friend, who was there, watched it happen and did nothing. while he is no longer in my life i feel like i will be the victim of the fulfilling prophecy. 

today i scared myself by drafting a suicide note and am now concerned that my suicidal ideation is getting out of control. often, i think about killing myself over trivial things that cause me anxiety. in this case it is passing in a garbage paper i know i'm going to fail. while i live in a constant state of anxiety, paranoia, and self loathing, but i don't want to die. i want live and experience life, just not the life i am living. while i know i'm not suppose to be guilty about it, i always feel bad about how materially well off i am but how mentally broken i am at the same time. really, everything in my life is going relatively well, i have decent grades and am transferring from community college to a four year school, i have money in the bank and a relatively new car, and i just started a new job as a bank teller. when i am not thinking about dying, i am thinking about all the possibilities in life and all of the things i want to do. i don't want to end when there is a possibility it can all get better. to make things worse the one friend i hang out with on a frequent basis is going through his own problems and has chosen to cut himself off from people and as much as i try to reach out to him i get nothing back. i do have a therapist that i see every week and she's great, but there hasn't been much reduction in my suicidal thoughts. i'm trying to ride it out but the loneliness and isolation is getting to me and i'm afraid i will impulsively end my life.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i've never been good at committing to much of anything, and i've finally reached a point where i'm burnt out. i am a constant disappointment to my friends and family, i achieve so much and throw it all away because i feel so undeserving. but to top it all off, the constant physical pain i am in seems to only get worse.

-split classes(would help a lot)

-not whole school break at the same time(logical sence...)

-mask mandated in class(some people are against it bla bla bla, people dont use their common sence sadly)

-provide stuff for protection against corona etc(i dont think they will do that because of the costs)

"i just don't care anymorehey guys so this isn't a super long thing but idk it's just like, what's the point. i don't even know where to start other than just what's the point. 

so i failed out of college like 3 months ago. right after that i started talking to this girl and things were absolutely amazing for the first like 2 months. we dated for awhile. then she just ghosted on me and now we're talking again but she's just using me to get free 100s on homework assignments and papers, like that's clearly all it is. and it's just like, why. if this is what life is then i don't want to do it

she's the only person who ever liked me, and now has just completely discarded me. doesn't care at all. i wish she would just hate me because then at least i matter

all i do is go to the gym, then go to work and stay as late there as i possibly can doing work and then just talking to coworkers, then come home and text ashley for a little while and cry myself to sleep. that's it that's all i do every day. and i'm tired of it. i was going to jump after i failed college but i stuck around to see what happens with ashley but since that didn't work out, why not go ahead and do it. seriously why not. i just can't get up the courage but i have a bottle of vodka so i'm hoping maybe i can drink a lot of that and have the courage to finally jump. fuck this, it's not worth it.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"arrangments.i am going to kill myself, that is a foregone conclusion and is beyond any possible retraction. that is not the point of this thread, the point is that at my age (33) things are vastly more complicated than they would have been had i gone acording to plan when was 18. that being the case,  i now am trying to get a handle on all the things i need to address before finishing the job so that i dont leave annoying loose ends for somebody else to have to figure out, it would be terribly inconvenient and i think rude. so, let's make a list of considerations that should be made beforehand. it bears mentioning that any useable part of my remains are to be harvested and the rest of my corpse is to be disposed of in the most expedient and least sentimental way possible, there will be explicit instructions that there will be no funeral or memorial services, obviously if my life wasn't even worth living there is damn sure no reason to tie up money a d other people's time in senseless ceremony and platitudes. so hit me with your ideas and reasoning.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my current conditionfirst, health:

i am obese. i have physically inept. i am the fat guy i hate. my diet is composed of the worst possible ingredients. things your body shouldn't be eating every day. i steal money from my parents to order junk food home. i then surreptitiously discard any evidence. i eat at the worst possible times. i shower every 4 days. i brush my teeth once a week. although, i sleep for 8 hours, i don't wake up until 11am. and it's not even deep sleep. i masturbate once a day. i spent more than 12 hours on the internet.

secondly, career:

i have failed my 1st year of college. and, here i am appearing for this exam again. the disappointment i have caused my parents. and yet, i haven't started studying. i am on my way to make the same mistake again. i ruined my 11th &amp; 12th grade examinations because of the same reasons. same with my first year of college. same reasons. and this time it's going to be three for three.

i had a dream of becoming the best football player of all time. that was reduced to the greatest footballer on the planet. then to a professional footballer. and now, that dream is non-existent. i don't practise. i don't dream. i have given up on that dream almost completely. i have lost my determination. same mistakes i made three years. same mistakes. same fucking mistakes!

and, yet i dream of these situations. these situations where i am funny, famous, fit, successful, cool, handsome and so many others. i live in my own fantasy. a fantasy that can't ever be actualised. a fantasy that's ruining my reality.

thirdly, relationships:

all my family members are thoroughly disappointed in me. i am probably the only one to fail an examination in the history of my family. something no one would have expected from me. my words have no worth to them. and you can't blame them. i don't have any respect. because of very good reasons. i have let my parents down. i am a horrible horrible investment. think of the money and the time and the resources that have been invested in me. and now look at the results. on top of that, i have no friends. none. one guy's there who i talk to once in a while. but i just lecture him about how he should live his life. yes, me. i lecture him. but he doesn't ask about me. or maybe he does and i can't reveal anything about myself. that's another problem for a therapist.

now, that i have described my current condition. let me tell you the worst part. the worst part is that i have made these same mistakes before. i have led this disgusting lifestyle before. not once but twice. if you make a mistake for the first time, you can be pardoned because you didn't know better. but if you keep making the same mistakes over and over again, you are the stupidest human alive!

am i addicted to the internet? am i addicted to junk food? am i addicted to being a shit? i don't know. i am thinking of posting this on reddit. but what's the point? what good will that serve? other than strangers finding out about the truth, the disgusting truth, about me.

and, frankly i don't even have the drive in me to change. i just don't. and that's scaring me the most. maybe i like being a lazy, disgusting, fat, worthless, unhelpful, useless, failing piece of shit. i am so lazy that i am trying to sleep on rock bottom.

"cowardice seems to be keeping me alive.last year i thought about suicide nearly every day. when i'd make lunch i'd think about how easy it would be just to stab myself with the largest knife in the kitchen. but i was too afraid of failing. if i survived i'd just get sent to a mental hospital to get ""better"".

around this time last year i planned on killing myself once i moved out for college if things didn't look better. it didn't, but i was still to scared of failure. 

so after the first month, every night before i go to sleep and as soon as i wake up, i imagine myself getting shot, i still do. i legitimately hope i get murdered so i don't have to do it myself. because i'm too much of a coward.

as to the why, i have fallen deeply in love twice throughout high school. i fell so hard up until the point where i just confessed my love for them just so i could get the fucking weight off my shoulders. the results were expected, they didn't feel the same, and i knew it going in. i never did anything sbout my feelings because i'm a fucking coward. now one of them is dating my best friend and the other is going to get married to a narcissistic douche who loves her. the confession to the latter happened in june, (we go to the same college) when i was at the lowest point in my life. since then i ever so slightly started feeling better. but being home for the holiday brought back all the memories i had with them and it just fucking hurts. why the fuck did i have to love people who don't love me back?

all that on top of me not knowing what the fuck i'm doing with my life and never being good enough at anything...i just want it to end....

when i listen to a certain song that conveys a melancholy emotion, i fantasize that i'm shot at the heart, killed in action. and i lay on the ground, my face lingered a remaining light, my youth is over. it's a beautiful way to die since i see this figuratively : my heart is too soft and big for this world, it had too much pain and being shot by a firearm symbolizes that it's excruciating than it ever was before. but then it's over.

and people i know, especially my loved ones had anguish in their faces that i never wish upon them. loud cries feasting around. 

it seems like a beautiful way to die. as i take my last breath, i smiled weakly, my eyes losing its light, chanting something similar to van gogh's last words.

"today is my birthday and also possibly my last dayit's past midnight, which means it's my birthday and i'm very tempted to make it my deathday. i've always liked when things line up, and if i was going to die by my own hand then i'd like it to be on my birthday. and i *really* don't think i can hold on for another year. every day is torture. every second that i'm not distracting myself by consuming some piece of media is hell. and it's starting to become not enough. i don't enjoy shows anymore and no song makes me happy. even the one thing i consistently enjoyed since i was a child is starting to become not enough to get me through a day. i spent all of today just doing things i enjoyed. no responsibilities, no worries, i just wanted to have one good day. and yet, at the end of it all i'm still empty inside. when i'm not feeling dread and self-hate, i feel nothing. i don't remember the last time i smiled. and i hate the way i look and how people see me. i hate myself and everyone in my life who failed me. 

so tomorrow might be it. this isn't the first time i've said this so it's hard for me to even take myself seriously. i have countless more posts. but i feel like this time is different. i don't feel desperate or frantic. i feel calm. it's been 6 months since i last posted on reddit. i thought i should stop because self-pity is addictive. but all it did was make me feel more alone and empty than ever. i don't have anybody in my life. i don't have a single friend. my family have given up on me, and i have given up on them. and i feel like i'm nothing. and i feel like it will never get better. but that's not just depression talking. because when i look around, there really is no one to help and nothing to live for. and if all i feel is pain, and if my death has no chance of passing that pain onto anyone, then i don't see a reason not to. maybe a few months ago i would've asked for help finding a reason but i know there aren't any. not for me at least. 

if today does end up being my last day, then i want to say thank you to anyone who ever read or responded to my posts. i didn't answer them all because i didn't want to disappoint people with how hopeless their attempts would be when i inevitably posted again but i appreciate every single response. you've made the past year slightly more bearable and that's the greatest help i could have asked for.",suicide,suicide,1.0

wow, three days! that's insane! as always, if you have any questions or topics for me, let me know in the comments. i'll see you tomorrow!  


fact: let's talk a little bit about saturn's lesser-known moons. as cool as they are, titan, enceladus, and iapetus can't get all the attention! there are 4 of them i want to give some info on, so i'm not going to waste your time here. let's dive right in!

&amp;#x200b;

dione: the first moon here is dione, which - like most moons - is tidally locked to its parent planet. however, there's something odd about the way dione is tidally locked. the side of dione that faces saturn has fewer craters than the side that doesn't face saturn. this is the exact opposite of what many scientists were expecting, and it could indicate that - at some point in the past - a massive impact may have caused dione's orientation to completely reverse!

&amp;#x200b;

mimas: this is my third favorite saturnian moon, and it's all because of one feature named herschel crater. to put it simply, it's a massive crater likely made by an impact that nearly obliterated mimas. it's so big that it makes mimas look like the death star from *star wars!*

&amp;#x200b;

rhea: back in 2008, nasa announced that observations from the *cassini* probe suggested that rhea could have a very small ring system! this would have marked the first time that any moon was known to have rings, but further *cassini* observations unfortunately revealed no evidence of ring material.

&amp;#x200b;

tethys: our final moon here is tethys, which is 97% as dense as liquid water. this suggests that the moon may be almost entirely made of water ice!

note: this was copied and pasted from my journal i started writing today. english isn't my first language, so please understand some grammar mistakes. i live in an asian country with a education system that grades students relatively, and puts more pressure onto the kids. so it may be different from the us.


a certain illness seems to have consumed me. depression, anxiety.. i can't exactly describe what is eating me up from the inside, but i feel as if a parasite is slowly eating me alive.

today was a bad day. i feel a temporary sense of comfort whenever i say the phrase ""today was a bad day"" in my head. it feels like that all the terrible feelings i'm having is just caused by a bad day, and that tomorrow things will be better and everything will come back to place. but it isn't. all my days are bad days. some are worse than the others.

i had a bad stomachache while i was going to school, and the bus was crowded and everyone was loud. i hate school. i hate every aspect of it. the teachers standing near the entrance checking the kids' uniforms, the posters and screens displaying pretentious videos about college admission, the chairs that are too rigid to sit, the florescent lights that are too bright and cold, the constantly shifting schedule, the teachers who don't seem to care about the students yet talk about college admission all the time and pressure kids to choose a major and a future job and plan out their whole career at 16. the kids that are too loud. everyone is too loud. everything is too loud.

sometimes i imagine what it would be like to be reincarnated into another person's body without my memory fully wiped. i feel like i'm living in another person's body. the only time i can feel truly myself is on the internet. i started a discord server a few days ago. everyone was great, yet i felt miserable. i felt as if i was tricking them into thinking i was a smart and funny person. i haven't felt this in a while, and i cling onto that sense of self worth and belonging i can never get in real life. 

in real life, in school, in hagwon, it's different. i am still that star trek obsessed kid who thinks too much and tells weird jokes, but nobody knows be. nobody knows who i am. even my mom, my teachers, the kids in my school, nobody knows me. i can never talk about things i love in real life. i can't talk about html and building my own website with anyone, i can't talk about star trek or memes, i can't discuss philosophy or talk about how school sucks and how bad my day was. i feel like nobody gets me offline. i don't feel accepted. i feel like i'm the permanent new kid in my life.

i'm not seen as a smart kid anymore. when i was younger i was the gifted kid that always got stuff right, knew more stuff than the textbook, the kid who was always correcting the teacher, the kid who everyone asked things they didn't know. i was the kid whose teacher, when they called their parents, always told them how their kid was a bright and gifted kid. everyone had high expectations for me, but now i'm disappointing everyone with my dropping grades and depression.

tbh, i feel like i'm tricking everyone who views me as a smart person. i feel like an imposter who everyone mistook as the gifted kid when i was younger. i feel like i'm one of the the r/iamverysmart people who insecure with their intelligence. i feel like my whole childhood was a lie. 

now people who don't know me well think i'm 'average"". worse, they see me as a lazy, creepy kid who forgets everything, doesn't understand social cues and eats lunch alone. i feel as if there is an underlying, constant ""rage"" about myself and everyone in my life. the ""rage"" sometimes makes me want to kill myself, or worse, kill everyone in my school. i feel like a terrible person, a being who can't be even described as ""human"" when i find myself imagining blowing up my school with a bomb. that ""rage"" seems to come from my insecurity. i feel so insecure sometimes that it turns into a full blown panic attack like i would never feel happy again, like every inch of hope has been sucked out from me. 

i'm confused about my dreams and major too. one day i want to be a programmer/developer, one day i want to be a professor in philosophy/history/neuroscience/astronomy, one day i just want to earn a living and be on the internet and game all day, one day i want to be a writer, one day i just want to fucking kill myself. my teachers pressure kids to choose their future jobs/major quickly. they are always doing activities that involve kids to write down their future majors and careers. i can't be honest with anyone, sometimes myself too. i feel like that ruined my whole dreaming thing beginning in 2018. i stopped to think about my possibilities and stopped being honest with myself and always thought that i was too late and wasn't qualified.

sometimes i have the sudden urge to get my shit together and do something with this life. then after a day when i find myself forgetting an assignment or procrastinating, i feel as if i can't never get my shit together and fall back into that viscous cycle again. this has happened to much to me that it sucked away the hope and made me thing i was going to be doomed forever.

"i'm so fucking close to offing myself!to sum things up neatly: i got sent to a hospital for anxiety, dropped out of school, lost all my friends, tried to kill myself, went to another hospital, switched schools again, tried to kill myself again, went to a different hospital, went to a residential, lost all my newer friends, went to another residential, switched schools again, didn't get credit for it, and now i'm having to repeat a grade at my old school. and i don't know how much longer i can take this shit.

i can't keep fucking texting people ""hey what are you doing tonight 🥰🥴"" (when i'm on the verge of an anxiety attack, fake-ass emojis included) or ""what are you doing for lunch today!!!"" (pretty enthusiastic for someone who normally sits and cries in the bathroom for the whole class period) and not getting a response when they're clearly on their phones, posting shit on social media. i try so fucking hard. i couldn't care less what other people think about me, judge me all you want, but it absolutely destroys me when i think about the fact nobody at all wants me, cares about me, wouldn't feel indifferent if i died in a fire-y car crash, or was found hanging from my ceiling fan for that matter. i know every normal, ~popular~ human being in the city of greater houston, been living there all my life, and still not one of them gives a flying fuck about me. i've been 'friends' with so many god damn people and there's still nobody i can reach out to when i feel this way, or who cares when they see the most obvious signs that i'm struggling. and if i drop the slightest hint, a calculated attempt to tell people i'm not doing okay without being branded as 'attention seeking', people will just answer me with a picture of them at some party guzzling down the piss water that is coors lite, probably having the time of their lives. i'm a 16 year old girl pouring out my feelings in a post on reddit, what am i, a fucking virgin? 

i feel like i'm not supposed to be here, like, on the planet earth. at first it was just a little twinge of loneliness every once in while, or being with a group of people and realizing that i didn't belong. kind of similar to living on autopilot, going through the motions because it's what others expect of you. more often that not, though, it's feeling numb, knowing that you're existing rather than living. i really try to do well in school, be social, kiss up to my teachers and make good grades, make plans with people that don't like me and invite myself to places i'm not wanted at, and none of it fucking pays off. it's not even really feeling like that everything you do is in vain. it's knowing that for a fact, and having personal experience: the last time i overdosed and was found passed out, choking on my own vomit, i disappeared for 6 months and not a single soul noticed. one night i showed up at a party (i left in september and came back in march), and a few people asked me, ""so you do online school now, right?"" 

i'm exhausted in every possible way. i don't know what i thought i would get from writing this. but if i am going to take away anything, help me out here: if i jumped out my window and down 3 stories to the ground, would that do the job? and would anybody find me before i start to smell?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i’m trapped. might shoot myself in-front of family.all i want is for someone to read this and give me their thoughts. please that’s all i need.

i am faced with a serious problem, and it could possibly end with me shooting myself in the head in front of my family. not that i want to do it, but the truth is that i have a ‘skeleton in the closet’ and if anyone found it, i would have no other choice but to end my life that i love so, so much.

this ‘skeleton’ i speak of is a fetish. abdl. 

involuntarily born with a fetish that disgusts nearly everyone. 

you might want to say “oh come on now, there’s other people with those same interests, they’ll accept you”. really. i have to rely on people online for social acceptance? 

what about important people, people i see in my actual day to day life. if they knew about my secret, it would be catastrophic, and that is quite obvious. 

imagine having a fetish and knowing that if even one person found out, then everyone will find out. i’m not gonna adopt wishful thinking like “oh people are accepting and kind, they won’t look down on me for being born different”

that’s bullshit. that’s not how real life works. if this was something like a foot fetish or some goofy shit like that then i wouldn’t give a shit. but no, i have to be born with one of the most embarrassing, humiliating, self-degrading fetish’s in the world. i didn’t ask for this. 

now believe me when i say i am grateful. i’m extremely grateful that i wasn’t born with any unethical/illegal fetish. sure, enjoying wearing diapers is fucked up but it is a solo thing and doesn’t hurt anyone other than myself. 

one of my goals in life is to have a normal loving relationship one day. if my secret stays in the closet, then this will be a possibility one day. if that secret were to get out, there would be absolutely no fucking chance that a woman could ever love me and i don’t blame them. i’m a fucking freak. 

i had an idea a couple of months ago. i thought, if this fetish just lives in my subconscious mind, controlling me all the time, why can’t i punish it? my subconscious mind wants me to avoid pain and discomfort obviously. so, i physically beat myself with a leather belt and various other things. this led to me doing it a couple more times (during bad breakdowns only). i thought i could punish my brain into behaving and getting rid of the fetish. sometimes i imagine a personification of my fetish, and i imagine beating it to death in very brutal, cruel ways for all of the shame it’s brought me.

i’m having a nervous breakdown now because i’m nearing the end of a one week road trip. i compulsively bought diapers the night before i left for the trip because i felt like it was my last chance. it was also my first time actually buying and wearing diapers for the fetish.

i indulged that night before i left for the trip. i’m paranoid that i didn’t hide the diapers well enough. my brother is house sitting while i’m on the trip. if he happened to go into my room (he often does) and find that shameful stuff, i would have absolutely no other option but to blast my brains out. another option would be to tie myself to something heavy and throw it off the dock. that sounds more painful than blowing my brains out but maybe that’s what i deserve. i am an unlovable abomination and if mom or dad ever have to lose me, i want them to know i didn’t want my life to go this way.
i want my parents to know that i love them.

i briefly listened to the dear hunter in the past. however i never really opened up the notes app and wrote down the story that was being told 

so upon relistening and reading others interpretations ive figured this much out about the story 

it's about a prostitute in a city who is being hunted down by her previous clients for reasons i dont know yet, she finds out shes  pregnant with a child who is to be cursed with a horrific life of sin and pain unless she raises him out on a lake away from the city. she leaves her job as a prostitute behind to raise her son in a sheltered life where he wont need to know the truth. she raises her son to be unlike the people that were hunting her down in her past.   however while she lived on the river, a church was established in the city. ""the pimp and the priest"" is the name of an antagonist were introduced to. people at a bar the mother (ms. terri) used to frequent, rat her out to the church and the priest hunts down ms. terri. eventually her past catches up to her and the priest stabs her to death in front of her son. her son (the dear hunter)  is left to never know his mothers past. unable to continue living in his home he gets on a train to seek out who his father is. he makes his way into the city which supposedly will corrupt him. ironically ms. terris lack of honesty with her son and desperate attempts to protect him had no effect as he would remain cursed. the fire may be gone but the flame still remains 

the story is filled with a ton of beautiful symbolism.

"the abuse is too much. i can't have his death on my shoulders.this might be lengthy. i'm sorry. it's all over but i have to get it out of me first.

i'm 18 and i'm getting married - but i don't want to; i'm trapped. if i don't marry, my boyfriend will kill himself. i can't have someone's death on my shoulders.

in retrospect, it's my fault. i was too stupid to see the signs. my boyfriend is an illegal immigrant and is only using me for his papers. but, when we first talked, he treated me so well. he acted like he really loved me, and would buy me many gifts. he always liked to cuddle. i pitied him because he was such a nice man, but in an unfortunate situation. i was ready to be his hero if he kept loving me. at least, that's what i thought. it wasn't even love, and he's certainly not a nice man now.

i moved out from east coast to west coast to be with him. i left my parent's house, college, work... family and friends. i foolishly left a life of security for something potentially dangerous. this is how i pay for that foolishness.

living on the west coast didn't work out. for the life of me, even though i'm very much a legal citizen, i couldn't find any work. it was depressing to have stooped so low. i speak mandarin chinese and have lobbied congress for public education funding in my youth group. i've beaten suicidal behavior before, having inpatient and outpatient therapy, and now *this*? where is the strong woman my mom talked to me about? that's what i was supposed to be. why did i give up for this man?

anyway, i moved back in with my parents. my boyfriend was going to be homeless on the west coast until his friends in chicago offered a room. he then wanted me to make a promise to him: ""*find work, then get an apartment and i'll move in with you. then we'll get married.*"" he told me he would die without me. at the time, i hadn't thought much of it.

i got a job at a small grocery - part time, minimum wage. it was the best paying position i could get in town without any college experience. first paycheck... $235. second one, i got more hours... $316. not enough money to get an apartment and pay for gas.

one day, i woke up to get ready for work and absolutely hated myself. the grocery is so busy, my back aches at the end of the day and i'm losing too much weight. the customers are just so evil! so i decided to call in sick, just this once. i told my supervisor i had vomited more than once and could not work that day.

i texted my boyfriend the same excuse i gave my supervisor. if he knew that i wasn't actually sick, and that i wasn't making money for him, he would have been so angry. turns out, even though i said i was sick, he was still very upset.

""*that's $50 you lost today. i'm not happy with you right now.*""

i was so mad! we didn't talk for a few days. i told him my phone was having issues, so he wouldn't be mad at me for wanting a break. well, i did a lot of thinking during that time. my therapist and i talked about it, too.

my therapist said something like, ""you know you're going to break up with him, so just get it over with. better sooner than later. he's no good for you, and i can tell that you know that. just take deep breaths and use your coping mechanisms."" of course, my therapist doesn't know the extent of his abuse. my boyfriend would be really mad if he found out. he would be hurt. i might have to be hospitalized again.

almost a month later, i finally got the courage to break up with him. i called him. i considered doing it by text message, but i've heard that isn't how you're supposed to break up with people because it doesn't give them closure. anyway, i dialed the number and he answered after two rings. we talked for almost two hours. i tried to remain calm and explain all the reasons why it just wasn't working out.

i essentially said, ""it's too difficult for me to support both of us. you need to get a job too, and you haven't. i can't keep caring for you like this because it's draining me. i wanted to be your girlfriend, not your mother. i'm sorry.""

he said to me, ""what? i cared for you on the west coast when you wouldn't get a job. how many months? almost a year on my salary alone. i let you sit there and do nothing and this is how you repay me? didn't we make a promise? oh god. you're completely ruining my life. you were my only chance in this country and now i have nothing to live for. i can't even return to my home country. you're selfish. even a friend wouldn't do this to me. i was a great boyfriend - i did everything for you!""

at this point, i started crying. he sounded like the people in the hospital ward - he sounded suicidal. if he died, it would be my fault for being so weak. i was letting someone die, because of my selfishness. surely a life is worth more than my happiness.

i told him i took it back. i apologized for over thirty minutes, until he finally agreed to let me be his girlfriend again. he told me we could pretend that conversation never happened. so, ten minutes later he says, ""*how was your day, sweetie?*""

now here i am. so selfish, so stupid. in my desperation for affection, i've traded nude pictures with men from a nsfw subreddit. my face isn't in the pictures, but it's strange for me to do this. i text men on the side to make myself feel better about reality. it's stopped working. i don't feel good anymore.

i don't want to live anymore. i can't escape. please don't say hurtful things to me. what is there left to do? there's nothing. i'm too young for it to end, but there's nothing. i could make it look like an accident so i don't disappoint anyone. so my boyfriend doesn't go after anyone and maybe doesn't kill himself. then i won't be sad anymore, because i won't be anything.",suicide,suicide,1.0

fast forward to 3rd grade and our teacher was pissed at our class so she decided to rearrange our seats, now... take a hot guess, who was chosen to seat with me. if you guessed sara, you were right.

we started getting along, having fun on lessons and lunch breaks. we were best friends.

fast forward again now to 4th grade. all the classes were mixed and we sadly weren't in the same one. we still hung out and stuff but didn't have as much time for each other as before. year 2016, february 14th, valentines day. ""it's my chance!"" so since we didn't finish lessons at the same time i gave my close friend a letter from me to give to her after school. he gave it to her. same day, just after class, she messages me and tells me she had a big crush on me since 1st grade ""the fuck!?"" was exactly what i wanted to say. so we started dating (as much as two 10 year olds can date).

5th grade. i was moving to another house so we broke up. damn, i really liked her (and i still do).

fast forward to 9th grade (present day). guess what. i'm in the same school as sara. our school is now in a 3 month lockdown so we have online lessons. while still in different classes, we text each other and have fun. i even have a plan to ask her out as soon as we get back to school and i'll keep you updated.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

- very violent mood swings (not physical violence)
- borderline emotionally abusive
- impulsive sex (with guys, girls, tvs, cds, escorts), lived a complete double life.
- gambling for endless hours playing internet poker 

(i'm pansexual btw and actually coming to terms with it despite being somewhat in denial about it for a couple of years)

i went to see a psychiatrist during this turbulent period as it was very distressing for me (as well as for her but thats a given). they said it was unlikely to be bpd as it didn't seem pervasive enough and lots of these things they said were somewhat normal-ish in periods of high life stress. 

anyway as i lay watching this documentary i noticed the cl killer:
- was a highly functioning medical student, who no one would have suspected to lead this double life
- was a loving boyfriend who 
- had issues with impulse control (gambling with online poker and sex)
- wrote his lovers name in his blood before killing himself in a shrine of photos, this is what really shook me in that i feel so sad and can relate so much to the helplessness he must have felt at his lover leaving him and being with someone else. but its also something that my emotionally unstable, manipulative self would have done to make sure my ex would feel the ""hurt"" i was feeling... completely psycho i know... (i'm not like this normally but i can relate to it is what i'm trying to say)

i should at this point add i don't have any impulses to hurt anyone, what is really distressing me most and making me feel like i should just end my own life is that i can relate to so much of what this guy went through and it is really making me think i am a similar breed, possibly capable of similar things if my circumstances were different (i am somewhat financially stable, and i really do keep sex and gambling under check for the most part despite inevitable relapses - it seems this maybe what triggered it, though this is largely conjecture).

i'm not sure what i'm looking for here, or if this is even the right place to post but i just feel very isolated right now and don't really know where to turn...",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i don't think i want to die but i definitely don't want to liveit wasn't that long ago that i was a motivated person with goals and values. i naively wanted to make the world a better place and to make myself worthy of the respect that i felt towards those that do make a difference. i even achieved some success getting my master's degree and then a decent advocacy job. i wasn't happy but i could convince myself to keep going in pursuit of some kind of greener pasture.

in the last 2 years or so, i realized there is no greener pasture. i don't really care about money outside of basic financial security. i've never had a friend or girlfriend that didn't disappoint me (not that i didn't justifiably disappoint a few of them) which makes me see no point in socializing. 

the one thing i'm passionate about, politics, has deteriorated completely and i find myself hating the people i used to be allied. i've put a lot of thought into our current state of politics and thoroughly came to the conclusion that there's no hope for things to improve in this regard anytime soon. most of the political/advocacy jobs i would have applied for in the past would now require my to compromise my ideals. as a result, i've been stuck working in marketing for the last 2 years and while i do have the skills, i hate it. it's starting to show and i know i can't continue there this depressed and unmotivated for much longer. i've been interviewing for other jobs for months now but i think the depression just emanates off me. i doubt they would be any better anyway.

i'm not a naturally sad or defeatist person and i've always been resilient about not letting little things get to me. but now that my sense of self is gone and after roughly 2 years of nothing good happening, those little things feel so much bigger. just waking up and going to work is the most painful chore i could imagine. that in turn makes me feel lazy and thus hate myself even more. i keep trying to distract myself with my simple joys like weed/beer, exercise and watching sports but the effect is wearing off and my state of numbness is perpetual now.

it's pointless to talk to anyone because, even if they do care, all they'll give me is facile advice and treat me like a crazy person that needs to be handled delicately. i certainly can't talk to anyone whose respect i value because i would lose it immediately. my parents are selfish cunts and the thought of having to move in with them because i can't get or keep a job definitely makes suicide very appealing.

i live paycheck-to-paycheck because of my ridiculous atlanta rent and student loan debt. my next paycheck comes on monday. i've said this to myself before and didn't follow through but i really think i'm ready to buy a gun and get this over with. the thought of being forever a failure does make me a bit sad but generally i see suicide very positively. i really don't think there's anything to look forward to and i don't think i'm depriving the world of any future positive contributions. i don't care how my parents react and my friends will forget me pretty quickly. i could probably go on being numb and distracted if life were easy and i had financial security but the minimal satisfaction i get from smoking a joint, watching the red sox, etc. isn't worth the painful chore of living in this world.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i dodged a bullet. so it's like 6 am where i'm at and i figured i'd share a story. so in 8th grade i had to do cyber school for a good half the year because i had missed a fuck ton of school. so while i'm just chilling and procrastinating, i get a call from a girl i didn't really know.



i pick up and it's a different girl i knew even less about. she asks if i know anyone who could love her. my response was immediately a ""look, you're asking the wrong guy. i haven't been to school in months.""



she sounds noticeably disappointed, so instead of awkward silence, i say ""alright, well i'm gonna get back to doing whatever it is i do on a daily basis."" to which she responds ""alright, you go back to masturbating.""



like *fuck*, never have i heard someone so passive aggressive. i'm 100% sure i dodged a bullet because i found out from a mutual friend later on that she was toxic as hell. and i know she was planning on asking me out too because that same friend mentioned i was single and the girl immediately wanted my number.

"my years of mistakes are too much for me to recover from. i think i need someone to talk to?i don't know what to say without typing for days on end. i guess i'll just type.

i have five children. and a loving husband. i am a college graduate, i have a job. i feel so hopeless and completely underwater that there's no real way out from here, even though those first few things sound great. 

i love my husband, and my children with all of my heart. i've had trouble with depression off and on for awhile, but even when i'm feeling 'ok,' i don't think it's for very long that i can go without causing trouble or making someone upset. i have relied on my poor husband for so long (7 years) to be my support while also treating him like shit. he's tired of it. i don't blame him. i imagine leaving for good, my only regret being that i couldn't make people happy before i leave. i used to be an amazing mother, playdates, fun activities, care and attention, loving patience. now i'm just cold and distant, sometimes seeing my beautiful daughter's face or watching my toddler learn new skills makes me incredibly happy but that happiness is beaten down with doubt and worry. i think about how wonderful my children are, and then a stab of guilt at having yelled at them the night before, or forgetting the invites for my son’s birthday, or not having enough time or attention to devote to each child comes to mind. i think… i don’t deserve this. i’ve had so many children that i cannot possibly and in any sane way keep up with them all and give them the love and support that they need. i feel so frustratingly and immensely guilty at having done this, made this bed for myself and this life for my family… i’ve created a life where there’s so much going on that no one has time for everything they need. 
then there’s my husband. i’ve treated him very well, and in many ways have been a really great wife. i outshadow those nice things, and i mean really, really outshadow them, by always worrying that he’s going to leave and accusing him of cheating. i did this in a different way in the beginning of our relationship. small dismissible lies from him turned into a huge deal for me and fueled my thoughts of him lying even more.  then, i looked on his computer without his permission and found exactly what i was looking for – dating sites and messages to women dating back months, and often very graphic. i deserved this. he told me in fights that i deserved that, and then recounted that idea to tell me he didn’t mean it. i think i hurt more because i know deep down, i deserve much worse. 
i’ve let down everyone in my life that matters. i have had second, third, fourth, fifth chances and each and every time i allow my guilt and worry ruin it. i genuinely don’t feel like i’m a good enough person to be here. thinking that makes me feel incredibly worse when i realize i have created a life in which a lot of people depend on me being someone worthy of being here. that is so, so selfish but i don’t know what to do. my husband often tells me that i just need to fix myself somehow, seek help, work on myself, talk to someone, correct my behavior. i have sought help, and a lot of it. not as much as i should, i guess since i am still here typing this right now. 
my husband really believes i want this, he believes i care about nothing else but being sad. he told me i don’t care about my children, about him, about anything, just my sad, selfish, crazy, asshole self. he yelled at me that if i leave, whether moving out or leaving the world for good, that i am continuing to ruin everyone’s life by leaving him ‘holding the bag’ from all of my mistakes. he said there’s nothing in the world i can do to make him feel better about me ‘completely ruining’ his life. i see it in his eyes, he’s frustrated. he deserved someone that could be caring and attentive and instead he got me. i feel really bad that anyone had to know me, that i ruined so many people’s lives just by being here. 
he never seems to listen when i tell him that this isn’t what i want. i don’t think i will ever be able to get through to him, the fact that i don’t want this, i just want everyone to be happy and in my own circle of kindness, self doubt, loss of self worth and yelling at him for stupid things like spending time with a female friend, i kill that hope. i will start arguments about really stupid things, like a worry that he’s cheating or that i’ve been a terrible mom. the thing is, i know these things aren’t true. i don’t actually believe he’s cheating, or any of the stupid things i yell at him. the truth is, i don’t feel like i can handle my life. i can’t keep working full time, trying to keep up with the kids, trying to be a good wife, that i let the slightest infrequent thought “she’s probably worth more to him because he hasn’t seen her yell at the kids,” or “i’ve already made so many mistakes that no good thing i do will right them,” turn into a self doubt that i turn on my husband. he might never know that i don’t really want to split up, i don’t hate him, i don’t hate my family. i really hate myself. if i give it enough thought, i realize that i often push people away because if they hate me, it will be easier to leave for good knowing that some part of them knew i wasn’t worth it just like i do.

the second more or less real attempt happened just an hour prior. both my parents were and still are not at home. i got everything set up in my room. i stood on the chair. i just had to kick it away, that's all that it would've taken. i chickened out again. everytime. now i gotta embrace at least another week of failing. disappointing anyone. i fucking hate all of this. i can't do this anymore but i'm also too much of a coward to off myself. i don't know how to progress. maybe some of you have some advice or... anyhting, really",suicide,suicide,1.0

"when you're truly hopeless.i remember quitting my job, pulling the covers over my head and thinking i just wanted the end to be here soon some months ago.  i thought maybe i'd figure things out, find some purpose and that would be that.  so here i am at the end of that depressive stupor with the realization that i was wrong.  i did everything to box myself in and create a situation that would make it easier for me to end things.  the comedy of life is that i'm so close to the end and i'm having second thoughts...that's common i've read.  it is unfortunately for me near hopeless.  
you read things like, people care, help is there, surely there are people in your life that will help you.  i am one of the rare ones in that there is nobody to help me.  i've largely lived a life of solitude.  i've been generous to people i've met along the way but their trains have passed.  i've even tried to reconnect with a few to no avail.  people really do move on with their lives and good deeds aren't often recalled.  it's in the past as if the past is something never to be revisited.  such is life i suppose.  i've nobody to turn to.  it's not for lack of trying.
god help me i'm trying to be a man about this, but i'm afraid.  i really am.  the idea of extinguishing life when i've actually come around to wanting to give it another go is tough to swallow.  i'll be evicted soon without a penny to my name and nowhere to go, nobody to turn to, without any help.  trust me, there's nothing there for me.  it's madness that my life is basically worthless.  it's almost a comedy that the $900 i need to have a roof over my head and try to reenter the world is insurmountable.  it was not so long ago a trivial amount to me but now it's shore that's so far away from me as i drown in the sea.  i see it but i know i won't reach it and i'll succumb to the waters.
i think to the things i did and enjoyed most.  hiking the appalachian trail solo off season by myself....working on a boat in the south pacific and looking at the stars at night all alone.  the road of solitude that i followed got me to this place.  i now wonder of what use was that road.  life's mysteries seem to have answers when you're near the end.  the tragedy is that i won't be able to apply them.  
i'm ashamed, i'm afraid and i'm resigned to my demise.  i don't know why i write this.  i know it won't do any good.  maybe there's a generous soul that can read this, understand it and see that i'm just a lost soul and not a con man or fraud.  i doubt that though.  it's probably that i write this more for me.  hail mary's and long shots are all that i seem to have.  we know how those end.

"4 years ago my mother said ""what could be so bad""i remember when i was 19, my freshmen year of college i was hospitalized for valentine's day for a suspected suicidal ideation.

i lived very far from my parents and it wasn't practical for them to come and visit. they were going to come, but i made sure to convince them it was all a mistake and they stayed home. i told them over skype the hospitalization was a mistake. my mother said to me, i'll never forget ""i don't know what could be so bad""
the words sting in my head. i lied. i had every intentions of killing myself, but i didn't have  an answer to her question.

"white-knuckling.i'm on a waiting list to see a therapist now, but it's a very long list. i'm in a rural area, so there aren't many (read: any) other options than to go through this organization. 

i've been in patient hospitalized three times before. i'm considering going back but it'd be hard on my job. i'm the only one in my department besides my boss. he's in charge of two other, way more important departments. no one else could pick up my work in the short term. i also don't want them to know about my mental health issues - i feel like i'd been seen as unreliable, more so than i already am. 

also no one could care for my cats. one is getting older. i fear when he passes because that will be one less thing holding me back. 

i have a chronic pain disorder that is almost unmanageable. it has hindered my life in so many ways. 

my mom killed herself five years ago this month. that's been on my mind. i've been living in the past for about 7-8 years. 

i really have more passive suicidal ideation than an active desire, but i'm worried that will all change in a moment. 

i resent the obstacles in my way. i don't know how much longer i can white knuckle my way through. 

i've been depressed for 15 years. i've been actively working on it for 10. it always comes back to this. i'm exhausted from managing and barely achieving the minimum level of self care.

"i'm at a loss.i've honestly been trying to get my shit together.

i saw a therapist. no help.

i saw a doctor who perscribed medication. some help, still feeling miserable.

i've tried excersize. i've tried drugs. i've tried no drugs. i've tried changing my settings, thinking maybe i was feeling trapped. i've tried cbt. i'm running out of options.

basic story, i'm miserable working. i've never had a job i've enjoyed. to me, going to work is one of the worst things i can think of. i'm going to work until i retire or die, meaning i'll spend my whole life working, and as i'm unhappy working, i'll be unhappy the rest of my life. i've swapped jobs multiple times, and the things i have interest in doing are unachievable. i can't become a rockstar, i'm just not good enough,  that's a fact.

so here i am. i begin wondering to myself, at what point is it selfish for the people around me to keep me around, as to avoid a bit of emotional turmoil.

is it fair making me survive a life i don't want to live so that they may put off missing me until i die of natural causes or they do? how's that fair? if i kill myself you'll suffer 2 or 3 years tops. nrops if you really like me. this doesn't equal my 50+ years of misery ahead. it just doesn't. 

this is what annoys me too, everyone thinks because i'm depressed i should be thinking ""oh i'm useless to society the world would be better of without me"" but i don't think that. i think if i was a normal motherfucker and not depressed i could live a good life. i have a good life. the only thing stopping me seems to be depression.

so tell me reddit, is there a point where it becomes selfish to keep a depressed individual around even if he worked hard and failed over and over again to deal with or fix his issues?

"not feeling so great anymore.i have thought about suicide since i was about 15, 25 now.  i've only ever expressed it to two people, both of which were my girlfriend's at the time, and it was during our breakup.  i've heard from a few people that the types that actually kill themselves are the people that don't say they are, not the ones that talk about it.

i've not been diagnosed with anything, but i know from research and family history that i suffer from bouts of depression and bi-polar disorder.

some back story on why i frequently think about doing it:
my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me recently and started dating her ex, who i found out was never really out of the picture.  i have a job at a decent company, but it prevents me from going back to school and attaining a degree, thus keeping me from moving up in my job.  my daily job activities are dull and i don't like what i'm doing, but i love the company and it's benefits. i'm in a lot of debt.  i don't have spending money, it all goes to bills.  my car got messed up recently and i don't have money to fix that.  i feel like my friends aren't good enough friends for me to ever mention this to or that they would be supportive if i did.  i don't have the gumption to try and meet new people.

my home life (i'm still with my parents because of my money issue) isn't great.  my dad suffers from bi-polar disorder but refuses to accept the fact and can become verbally abusive to my mother and brother.  my brother suffers from it, but takes medication for it, so it's not so bad.  my mom seems to be at the end of her rope with all of the problems in her life.

i have already emailed my husband a locked file with a password he would know, all the passwords and user names to bank accounts, bill accounts etc. slowly over the past month i have been changing things to his name so he doesn't have the headache of fighting with the electric company etc.
even a charity group i am in will just say ""that sucks"" and have a memorial service in may as they do with all members. i can already hear one woman say how selfish i am, another making it about her. i will get a quick ""sweet in our memory"" then that's it. 
my own sister wont care. i talk to her almost daily lately but she has been all about her trouble and none of mine. i truly feel my memorial service will be empty. i cant get someone to come to a party let alone anything else. 

i know even my reddit gift exchange will suck this year. my giftee got theirs and loved everything. in past years i get sadly bad exchanges. (once had to be regifted twice)

i feel like no one will care. my cats will miss me, but they will have husband and get over it in time. 
thanks for letting me rant one last time. good night all.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"updatei talked to one of my friends who i thought i could trust to not tell anyone. weeks went by since my last post, around the time i decided to seek help from him.
today he the sergeant who is in charge of me and then bam, my now personal problem was public. open to the worst people to find out. it went up the chain of command really quick, like snap of finger quick. the schools gunnery sergeants immediately called me in to talk to me to poke and prod at me, but with no hope i couldn't find the issue even from the depths of my mind. the sadness i have is not caused by one specific thing like these people are assuming. they talked to me a while and offered the chaplain (church) services here on base, and they also offered the mental health clinic. obviously i didnt want to classify myself as a patient of the mental health clinic so i leaned towards the chaplain services... i went back to the bathroom try cry a bit and decompress that my internal problems that were now external. i was walking out of the bathroom and my sergeant told me to grab my stuff, and immediately my heart sunk again. i guiltish-ly walked back into the marine break room and grabbed my gear, and walked back into the hallway running face to face with my sergeant. he told me to walk with him, and as i did he discussed the fact that he was taking me to the mental health clinic here on base. that fact really stunted my thoughts and all i could think of was, ""what the fuck did i get myself into"". i get into his car and the heat of it immediately makes me sweat. my face was pale, my eyes red, and now i am sweating. f*$king great. he drives me to the clinic and talks the the airforce lady at the desk and she then ask for my id and tells me to fill out these papers. its that typical bull-sh!% paperwork like, ""do you feel like hurting yourself"" ""do you feel like hurting others"" ""do you feel okay?"" ""do you have loss of apetite"" to which i sorrowfully checked the ""sometimes?"" box. after turning this packet of my now public problems i proceeded to play with my cover out of a sort of frantic-panic tendency. my sergeant was awkwardly sitting next to me and he was probably playing clash-of-clans or some other phone game because i kept hearing some *bling* *tsk* every now and again. the sound was the only thing my ears were processing because it was slightly starting to piss me off. after what seemed like a lifetime, a shorter blackish grey haired woman came out and softly whispered my name. with me being in this internal state i hardly heard the door open. the only reason i responded was because i noticed my sergeant sit up in his chair, and take his eyes off the phone. i walk down this very eerie hallway with the woman, and she leads me into this office. once i was sat down another airforce gal entered, who i had assumed was being trained. she was an enlisted and the older lady was an officer. while i awkwardly sat in this chair, still playing with my cover, the older woman proceeded to flip through my papers. she breaks the ice with some stereotypical questions that you think a shrink would ask. pretty much the same damn things the papers i filled out asked. with her soft-spoken voice i felt very soothed, and the fact that she wasnt there to harm me made me feel better. the tears stopped from my eyes and i regained composure mostly because she wasnt prodding me for answers. she wasnt forcefully asking me to give every detail about how i felt, she just wanted some background knowledge. after a while of discussing family history, my personal feelings, telling her i did not want to harm myself or anyone (sometimes i do but thats normal right?), and after all the seemingly pointless questions she began to lead me out. we walk back down the hallway that we entered through, but this time i noticed a button locking the door. you had to physically push a button to exit this hallway. how fu@ked is that. do they lack trust and security that much to where they install a button to exit a damn hallway. anyways, i continue out to see my sergeant joking about some games with the others that seemed to appear out of nowhere in the waiting room. he stands up as me and the older gal exit the hallway. i walk up to the intake window and schedule my appointment to to get seen for my first ""intake"" therapy. apparently there they will decide if i need medication, therapy, and what my issue is.
i write this not necessarily as a story, but as an update. i posted my problems on this sub-reddit and read a lot of others problems on this sub-reddit. 
i just wish to inform everyone that there is a way out of this shell. it does suck to let this information go public, especially being so young (they just assume its teenager hormones amiright?). 
my only issue with this becoming public is now i have the title deemed over me of ""has mental health issues"" and my superiors see me as a ""broken marine"" and they say ""broken marines cant function properly, so we need to help them"". 
i just want to state that i personally believe it should not be classified as a mental health problem/issue. this may sound contradicting of itself but, i do know that my mind has problems. i do know that depression is an issue. although, i do not believe someone should be classified as a person with ""mental health issues"" it demeans my name, and who i am. it makes me feel lesser of myself, and puts me into a deeper sorrow when i think of it. it shouldnt be a title to someones name. i want to thank everyone on this subreddit for their advice, not necessarily on my post, but on others. i read the comments on others post and feel slightly better because i know others can relate, and there is hope/",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

please see (https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/3uowvm/loosing_motivation_feeling_worthless_self_esteem/) 
i used to be a very cheerful and happy person years ago. i had everything i could ask for and was successful and doing well. now things have changed (see linked post).

i don't know what to do and apart from academics i have a ton of other problems. 

i drank some bleach and then realized i shouldn't do that and that it would affect the few people i know me. i vomited it out instantly and did not drink a lot. 

i don't want to be like this. i want to go back to who i was and restart everything. what i hate the most is that i am acting differently around people because of my mental state. 

i am an extremely patient person, and i could really bond with people because of that and people liked me. now i want to stay far from everyone cause i fear i'll hurt them.

""i have always been interested in the field i am currently studying. i got many awards for it, achieved a lot in it before entering university.

however when i entered university things did not go so well for me due to sickness and other reasons. i am in good health now (maybe not mentally) however since i failed some courses and did excellent apart from my failures. this makes me feel scarred.

i feel worthless and i keep underestimating myself. this is a vicious cycle because it leads me to do worse and worse as time goes on. i fail to get what i want in every aspect of life these days not just courses. i present myself as an idiot.

i can't believe what has become of me right now, from what i was. i miss my old self, how can i go back. i just wish i could restart everything but i can't. i had hopes for graduate studies now i will never get that. i need some successes to boost my self esteem but for successes i need self esteem.

i am devastated and can't believe she has done this. i myself struggle with depression and anxiety and sure thought about suicide many times but never really saw it as an option. i have so many questions as to why she would do this, even though i'm guessing it has to do with my parents shitty marriage.

"i don’t think there’s a way for me to get better. i have an ethical obligation to kill myself.i don’t think that there is a way for me to get better. i have spent a year and a half dedicated only to trying to get better. at 17 years old i find myself in the exact same place i was as a 15 year old in sophomore year. people keep telling me “things will get better” i don’t think they will. i think i’m different. you can read my previous posts for a background of my symptoms. anyways the only way i kind find any sort of joy at this point is by distancing myself from the world. playing video games and being high are the only things that make me feel anything.

i digress, i think that i’m doing a disservice to myself and my family if i continue to live. a. i am putting myself in pain for no reason. i don’t think there is a point for me to suffer any longer. for a long time the thing that kept me from seriously considering suicide as my exit strategy was my family. 

recently i came to the realization that i’m not going to get better. if i continue to live i will only be in pain for the rest of my life. this brings me to my second point. b. it’s unfair to keep my family hopeful. i’ve accepted the fact that my life on earth is done. i think it’s a fucked up thing to do to keep them thinking that things will turn around when they never will. it’s best to end my life so that they can let the thought of me go and get on with their lives.

i am pretty sure i’m going to go through with it. i’m going to go to one more therapy session. i’ll tell my therapist about my thoughts and give him a chance to convince me otherwise. my last hope is that these are just delusional thoughts that every person who is “depressed” has. sadly i’m confident that i’m thinking clearly. 

i wish that i hadn’t been born. i wish that i didn’t have to worry about the well being of my family. it makes this so much harder. i want to get over with this and just be gone. every time i look at any of my family members i want to cry. they have no clue how much pain i’m going to cause them. i hope they are all right. i fear i’m going to cause my parents to get a divorce or cause one of my family members to fall into depression. the world would be better without me. if i simply didn’t exist. fuck this.

i digress, i’ll probably write a goodbye note to reddit. i’ll write one to my family and i will write a note to the world and society in general. 

until then, i’m unsure of how i’m going to kill my self. i’m scared of using a knife or hanging myself. i don’t think i could cut myself and i’m scared banging myself won’t work. i don’t think i can get my hands on a gun because i live in an extremely privileged white community in the suburbs of grand rapids. i think the person who i would ask for a gun would be suspicious of me. i’ve thought about using my car but i don’t think i should fuck my parents over financially as well. this all leads me to pills. i don’t know what i would use but i need it to work. surviving would be too much pain for me and for my family. any suggestions drugs or otherwise are appreciated.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i am in my car.when i re-enter my house, i am either going to hang myself with a belt from my bathroom door, or go to sleep. 

i am too exhausted to explain properly how i came to be where i am. i can’t remember a period of time in my life where something awful wasn’t going on. i am not coming here for pity, i just need to vent. i am a 22, would be 23 this day next month, year old woman. for five years i have been dealing with an undiagnosed, seemingly untreatable chronic illness. this chronic illness has made it impossible to lead a normal life. i have lost each job i held because of it, have had to leave education because of it, and can’t engage socially because of it. it leaves me on the toilet for 12+ hours at a time, crying in pain. 

i am seemingly unable to control my emotions. everything felt so intense always. now, it’s numb. i have been in a turbulent relationship for the past seven months. i love the man more than anything i have ever loved. i treated him so poorly in the first four months of the relationship. i was emotionally abusive because i was so needy. he broke up with me three months ago. i changed everything about myself to keep him. i can confidently say i am no longer emotionally abusive. i hate what i did to him. i broke him down to nothing. he stayed and waited while i fixed myself. 

we decided to move out together. he currently is living in my mum’s house with me. my mum’s house will be sold from under her within months. due to my illness, i need a place with two bathrooms. it’s difficult to find a place like that where i’m from, and within our budget. 

my partner and i had a huge argument last night because of my problematic permanently aggressive tone. i can’t remember a time when i didn’t engage people aggressively. not purposefully most of the time, it’s just the way i speak. he interprets it as though i am having a go at him. it triggers memories of when i was emotionally abusive and it hurts him. since last night, i have mended my tone. i am trying. 

today we went to a house viewing. i liked it, but it was too far away from his work. he then told me the house search was too difficult and that it would be easier for him to move in with his friends. after our argument last night, he’s not sure whether he can live with me. i understand. this is my fault. i take responsibility. 

unfortunately because of my inability to feel emotions at a normal level, i am unbearably hurt. i was very excited to begin a life with him. for reasons i don’t have the mental wherewithal to explain, him not moving into a place with me scuppers my ability to find a place. i can’t afford it alone, as i am on benefits and i have exhausted all areas of support for people in my situation. 

i am very tired. being chronically ill is incredibly mentally taxing. i can’t tell my partner how i am feeling as i don’t want him to bear the burden. if i tell him how i feel, it is emotional abuse. he is already a shell of a person. he cannot handle my state of mind. my mum is on holiday and my dad lives an hour away, so i rarely see him. i’m so tired right now. my partner will be home from work in a few hours, back to my mum’s house that i am currently parked outside. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. i have nothing. i have abused the person i love the most to the point he feels like we can’t have a normal relationship. without him, my life is a meaningless cycle of illness. i can barely afford to eat. i don’t have friends. i’m sorry i don’t know where or what to say. 

if i go to sleep, this pain will persist when i wake. when i kill myself, i will no longer have to deal with illness or the seemingly imminent breakdown of my relationship. i wish it were more instant with hanging as i don’t want my last moments to be gasping for air or grabbing at my neck.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"in a rut, to say the least.to give some background: i am diagnosed borderline personality disorder with comorbid bipolar, aged 22 and a current university student that lives alone.

 since i was little i had the urge to destroy things that i loved, not people, it'd never be that. maybe toys, tearing apart my favourite soft toy for example. i've always been a very negative person. when i began to grow older this really came out and i suffered (and still do) prolonged periods where i would almost habitually self injure, but i would never think of killing myself.

things were looking up, moving away to a new place and getting entered into the mental health system, a mixture of cognitive beavhioural therapy and a regim of venlafaxine (an snri). recently things have fallen apart. my psychotherapist missed an appointment in november as he was ill. i have phoned and phoned to rebook it but this never happens, despite being told it's important and that i'm definatly not struck from the records. likewise my psychiatrist sent my appointment letter to an address i haven't used in year, casuing me to miss an appointment with her. i have tried to contact her but my gp can only do so via mail. i'm so scared that i wont be able to get back in to this health system as i think i still need it. to make matters worse i recieve a letter today, telling me to come to an appointment on the 15th of february, i don't know why it didn't arrive here but i think this might've been the last oppertunity to get the help going again.

i'm sick of not sleeping, i'm sick of my meds not working. i'm sick of needing to take either temazepam or zopiclon on a revolving basis just to get the tiniest semblance of sleep.

this worry has all piled up and i pushed beyond my usual threshold so i guess now i'm the polydrug abuser that everyone always knew i would be. i made myself a series of (no doubt stupid) promises, and even touching heroin was on that list. the person i was, or should be, isn't the person that's writing this. i mean, i am, but it's not [my name]. i can't convey this.

i don't know if i can kill myself. the occasional negative thought becoming overwhelming has had me consider it before, but for the last week or so all i can think about is suicide. it seems like a practical choice for me. i've been abandoned by both my psychiatrist and my psychotherapist, i doubt university will ever amount to much for me, i've finally come to that level where i've taken the drugs i promised myself i wouldn't touch. 

i've lost all the love for everything i once had. it's not just an apathy. music, reading, writing, films. they all seem like i'm being bludgeoned with something but the only other option is the intense, crippling silence which gives my thoughts free reign.

i honestly don't know what to do.

do i come here for help? no. you don't know what i go through. what might best suits you, won't suit me, in fact that is the worst thing you could do to people like me.

&amp;#x200b;

if you are a wizard, make it that i get to be born again, in a healthy attractive body, in a country like usa, while my parents have billions on their bank accounts, and i'll be pleased to start my life again. hell yeah! bring it on, i can't wait. 

&amp;#x200b;

a lot of people say ""money don't bring happiness"", we all know it's a lie, to a certain extend. we might as well say ""poverty doesn't kill"". just as money does bring us closer to happiness, poverty brings as closer to death. 

&amp;#x200b;

i started to write a book, because in order for people to understand something, they need to know you are there too, and in my life, i went through many things. that's what i thought this topic would be about, but as i'm writing it, i get to wonder, what for... what will it change? it will most likely disappear in a wave of new topics that are posted here daily. a lot of effort for nothing, i could sum up my life with this line. 

&amp;#x200b;

i never really got a seriouss reply here, even though what i always wrote was long, deep, and detailed.  

&amp;#x200b;

i wonder is it because i'm a foreigner, a 31 y.o. male, or all this is just too much to handle. 

&amp;#x200b;

one thing that i realized. people don't commit suicide becase they are afraid of it, they chose life in measury. i had these kinds of thoughts since age 8, 31 now, that's quite long, and i get closer all the time. 

&amp;#x200b;

i got up at 7 am today, prapared everything, and once again unfortunately hanging didn't go as planned.

rule 1b, if i wrote you what i felt today afterwards, that would be enlighting. experiences like that are one of a kind.

i have a loaded black powder gun hidden in my basement, but i'd rather die peacefully. euthanasia is not an option, but know this, all roads lead to death. amount of hours, days, month, years, attempts, doesn't matter, because it only gets us closer. noone asked me if i want to be born, but if i was a sheiks son, i wouldn't object. i'm not. i'm nobody, i have achieved nothing, there is no way to improve my situation, i can't hit the fucking jackpot, i'm such a worthless being i can't even kill myself.

live this nightmare and earn **509,01usd** a month? lol, no. when i was younger i used to wrote all over some random us forums, ""adopt me"", then years later, ""marry me"", to get an american citizenship, and after that, i tried to get the green card, but failed.

we haven’t been friends for that long ( we’ve met before but lost contact for like a year), but shes really nice and pretty good looking. she’s also extremely talented. she’s not exactly the “type” i would see myself going for,, but that’s not really too important to me.

this stage really started like 2-3 days ago. when it first started i though that i could give it a shot with her. i hadn’t though about being in a relationship with her long enough to really decide if i had a crush on her or not, but i figured i’d just give it a chance and see. i guess i did kind of started developing real feelings for her.

now the issue: today it just kinda feels different. like idk if i really wanna do this or not?? but i’ve been kind of flirting back and i would feel horrible if i were to tell her that after flirting with her. it’s just all kind of confusing.

it isn’t really a definite “i’ve lost all and any romantic feelings for her” more of an “i don’t know if i really like her or not???”

1. bad shit happens

2. get sick enough to do something about it.

3. good shit starts to happen.

5. everything falls apart as soon as things start looking up, despite my best efforts.

6. rinse and repeat.



i feel like i'm fighting a pointless battle, and that any victory is pyrrhic as best. i'm so sick and tired of not being good enough; of coming so close only to fail, of being so damn useless and feeling so damn powerless.

relationships are few and far between, and they never work out. i've been unemployed for the last year, and my last job was a part time seasonal gig that interrupted an eighteen month stint of nothing. 

i'm 22 years old. i should be a fucking college senior or looking at picking up sergeant, not being a fucking loser who lives off the charity of friends and family.

i have nothing left to lose, but i'm not really gaining any ground either. i'm a burden to those around me, barely pulling my own weight. the lowest common denominator in our problems is ourselves. i've done everything i really know how to do, and i've gotten nowhere, so why not just remove myself from the equation and make this easier for everybody?

yes, i'd be letting the bad guys in my life win, but this isn't a fucking storybook, this is real life where the bad guys win all the time. what's one more casualty among the masses?

i'm so tired of fighting, so tired of coming so close, only to lose it all. what's the point?

"not sure if it's worth it...i'll explain what i mean.

i'm at a position right now where i can improve the quality of my life but don't feel like i should. the entirety of my life has completely unraveled towards recreations that include alcohol abuse, a stint of prostitution, shallow friendships, and destructive romantic relationships. this year i turned 25 and voluntarily committed myself to a behavioral psych ward one week before my birthday. i left work early one day after a particularly stressful morning filled with whispers about my lax in productivity and drove my shaking and hazy self to the emergency room to tell them i thought about jumping off the building at work.

i got on antidepressants for the first time in my life and tried going to group therapy one week after i was released (but stopped going a short time in). i'm an irresponsible and angry person down to my core. i do understand a lot of people aren't completely without faults but i view myself as a fault. in fact, my past mistakes make me feel like i'm tainted in a way. like, my sins have made me unable to connect with seemingly 'normal' people. i don't feel like i have many things in common with the people in my day-to-day life. i've had four jobs in these past six months and quit after a week at each one of them. i left my own place to move back in with my alcoholic and childish mother who grates on my nerves. i sometimes think i'm just on a path to end up like her.

but lately i've found work as a seasonal worker at a department store and use that to make ends meet. i've been looking for a second job to help my finances and for me to move away from my mother. everything was okay for these past two weeks until i called-in to work yesterday and today. my old habits have come back and i'm just going to end back up sabotaging myself to unemployment and mental anguish. i sometimes sit and for wonder if i'll ever learn to be a successful member of society? will i just live a life being paranoid and irritated by daily responsibilities and fear of being with other people? i have thought about killing myself for around three years lately. ever since i dropped out of high school, i've lived an aimless life. i'm from a poor family from the housing projects so i've never really experienced the atmosphere of stability or success. i don't know if i want to continue living a life with no prospects. it feels like people tell me 'it's okay' and 'things will pass' when they don't realize how tired and confused i am. i took some of my mother's prescription pills in her cabinet to try and sleep the day away today. i think about taking a handful of them to get it over with. i mean, my logic has become that 'i'm going to die eventually so why not just do it now? things are not going to improve; they never do.'

"people just don't like mefuck them. nobody fucking likes me. it's all because i'm a socially awkward fuck who keeps to himself. i will never have what other people have because it's too hard to change. this just pisses me off. everything about socializing pisses me off because i'm so bad at it, but it's too necessary, and i hate being alone. i hate being with people but then i feel like my life sucks because i have no friends or connections and i will never have either of those things. i just don't give a fuck. this shit makes me so angry that i just wish the worst kinds of emotional pain on other people in general. i want my family to be hurt, even though they did nothing wrong besides not give a shit about me. i never felt loved by my fucking family and i don't give a fuck how much any of them actually do love me, they fucking suck at showing it, which i guess circle back to how i turned out this fucking way. i don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. i'm completely enraged by my existence. they have plenty of fucking letters to read when i'm done. i don't care if any of this is my fault, i don't care if just being angry and petulant about it makes me an immature fuck who needs to grow up, i'm just done. i'm sick of life and i am pissed the fuck off. i'm going to end up homeless on the street and if my life gets that bad, i will probably do very horrible, awful things that will just make everyone hate me even more. i'm just sick and tired of everything and i want to be dead.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"another person in my family committed suicide todayi’m terrified because i’m going to end up like my grandma who killed herself today and my uncle (6 years ago). bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and drug addiction run in both sides of my family. i’m 19, but i’ve been deep in it for years, the schizophrenia only the past year. every single day is revolved around making sure there’s not a minute i’m sober and doing literally anything to make sure i don’t run out of a substance. i can’t connect with my mom or sister anymore. she’s 30 years clean and my sister is.. just so normal. and i mean that in the best way possible. 

i’ve been preparing for my death by writing notes, cleaning things up, finding the best way, etc. then i got the call today. my mom had a horrific childhood and we loved my grandma, but nobody liked her. everyone stopped caring if that makes sense. my mom especially. so to hear her so torn apart by her death, absolutely shattered me. i know i’m selfish and fucked in the head, but i feel so trapped. i cannot do that my mom and sister, they’re the only reason i haven’t done it yet. i’ve been in psych wards, consistently took meds, went to rehab after my last suicide attempt in december, therapy since 5 because of sexual abuse by a family member, everything. i’ve tried so hard but no matter what, all these things creep up on me and the only way to not just say fuck it and do it is to stay inebriated. i can’t handle the pain anymore. i’m weak. 

i was a 14 y/o prostituting myself to get weed which lead to harder things over time. by the time i was 16 i’d been with over 200 men and i’m not even attracted males. i’m just a body to be inside. it’s all i know. i’m also transgender ftm and think i regret hormones and surgery at 14/15. idk anymore. i feel like my body is mutilated for many reasons. i’m tired. i hate being so fucking selfish but when i’m sober too long or the meds aren’t working, i will kill myself. it’s so much i can’t explain. this is what they went through, i am following their paths to t. the only difference is i tried to get help before. it was pointless.  we’re going out of state tomorrow for at least a week to take care of everything with my grandma. i’m freaking out because i’ll have to be sober and i haven’t been for even a day in months. i hate myself for thinking like that but the nature of the trip on top of knowing the mood swings will start, voices come back, withdraws, etc is so much. i’m almost angry i have to go. i’m disgusting. 

i know this was all over the place but i have no one to tell so i needed to get it out. i’m stuck here. it’s basically a slow suicide with how much i use but i am so fucked. i have no idea what to do anymore.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my teacher smashed my classmates ""phone"" (sorry for bad english)

i live in germany and i go to a electrical engineering school since a week or so. we have there a teacher that i found pretty unlikable because he constantly behaves like we know everything already and speaks to us like we are dumb kids if we are a little bit behind. like i already said i go to a electrical engineering school so phones are mostly allowed in class, except his class. and so, today, a class mate of mine took his phone out during the class and as soon the teacher saw the phone he instantly confiscated it and started to scold my classmate. but then, without anyone saying or doing anything, he completely flipped and started shouting things like "" we are here not at vacation "" and through the phone at the ground with full force. it shattered in many pieces and the whole class was instantly quiet. i thought that dude gonna beat the hell out of the teacher but no. he just sat there looking confused af. no one could believe what they just saw myself included. and then my teacher starts to laugh like he did the most hilarious prank that ever existed. and then what literally no one expected, my classmate also starts to laugh and then while looking at us he says "" what you guys thought that was my real phone ? "" . it turns out he had an iphone and iphones dont break in pieces like that. at first he wanted to beat the teacher up for breaking his phone but after realizing that it couldnt be his phone he stopped. finally after every one was left confused the teacher says that he bough an broken phone just for such instances and that he put my classmates phone in his pocket then taking out the already broken out and smashing it. after giving him his phone back he said ""no seriously dont use your phones in my class"" and then continued the class. i was left shocked i tell you. i still dont like him but that gave him huge bonus point in my mind.

tl;dr: teacher confiscated a phone, switched it with an already broken phone and smashed it in front of the whole class to teach them not to use phones in his class.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"will i be happier if i lower my expectations?i've been dealing with self esteem issues recently and it's been seriously fucking with my mental health. 

i used to be really ambitious and hopeful as a kid, then life did what it does and made me realize that nothing will happen the way that i want it to. that nothing will be easy. that everything and everyone will disappoint me at some point, and i won't even always be able to be mad at them because it's not always their fault. it's just the way things are.

i used to have a lot of hopes and dreams for myself and my life and i'm at the age where i'm seeing more and more doors close but not a lot open. i'm looking around at everyone else my age and they're all so hard working with plans for their future and i'm just not like that at all. 

i want to improve but i feel like it's just not going to happen. i'm not as great as i or anybody else thought i was. i can't help but wonder if i just accept that i'm a piece of shit and that life itself is garbage, my expectations will be so low that i'll be able to cope with the shittier aspects of life better and whatever sliver of good that does happen will actually make me happy, if even minutely.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

i’ve not been able to work in those 10 years because of my need to not be away from home for more than a few hours at a time due to my mother’s health.  my wife’s job has been our soul source of income for she and i this whole time, and now she is leaving me.

yesterday, my mother’s doctor decided that she is not likely to be able to stay home any more.  my mother is being placed in a skilled nursing facility and when my wife is finally gone, i am going home alone.

alone.  unemployed.  no income.  no way out of this hell that i find myself in.  we live 45 minutes from the nearest town of note.  i haven’t had much of any contact with any friends in so long that i can no longer reasonably call them friends.  i am alone in the world.  and i don’t think that i can handle it.  all of this at once.  it is too much.  my world has ended.

i don't know how to get out. i think there's no way. i live my life and try my damndest and there i am back where i started. there was sense it all meant something at some time or another, and that in the future i'd win the day and it'd be clear that i was made all behovely for this world.

"how to have a conversation about my suicide attempt with a family member?about 13months ago i attempted suicide. i have mild ptsd from the experience, and often have panic attacks that seem to be brought on by triggers of some kind. the issue is that i can't recognize my panic ""triggers"" because i'm missing 5 days of memory. it's this weird fog where i get a tiny glimpse of a memory but i can't really place anything about it. i remember taking like 300 pills, and waking up in the hospital 5 days later full of iv's and with an intibation tube down my throat. 

my therapist thinks that the only way i'll be able to fully move on and heal from the experience is if i get an idea of what exactly happened. she thinks hearing about the event might jog my memory in a way that would help me piece together these tiny snippets of memory. i currently have no idea who found me, how long it took them to find me, whether or not i was conscious, ect. i know that i was vomitting everywhere, and that i had to be flown via helicopter to the nearest large city for medical assistance because my city's hospital wasn't equiped. that's the extent of what i know. 

my triggers seem random and sporadic, the only things i can clearly recognize as triggers are seeing people foaming at the mouth, and the idea/mental image of swallowing poison. the only person who knows what happened fully is my mom, but i have no idea how to ask her about it. we haven't talked about it at all since it happened. i don't wanna just ambush her in the car or something, but i also don't want it to get too serious. i just need simple answers.

"so... thinking about it. again....arguments with my wife have occasionally made me feel like this. it's my 2nd wife. cheated on the 1st, got 2 boys with her (9 and 11 - crazy names, might change them next year...) . current wife is really struggling with how she sees their behaviour (on the occasional times she's around them - due to her work, and when we have them here) they're generally not naughty kids, they're just... kids... and sometimes they fuck up. don't we all. they obviously try and lie to stay out of trouble when they do fuck up, but my wife hates lying.

so, tonight i was having a stern word with the eldest after he lied about peeing on the toilet seat. he was stood there, started to wobble and sway, then literally went rigid and started to fall. luckily i caught him. after i got him safely onto the floor he was hyperventilating. was very scared and confused as to what happened. wife is saying he's being a drama queen and putting it on and i fell for it. i think he got himself so wound up and anxious and had some kind of blackout. wife calls bullshit, and now we're not talking. the passion (from her side) left a long time ago, and now she despises my kids' behaviour. and me.

he's fine now, back at his mom's.

i currently help look after stepdaughter who has quite some disabilities and complex needs. 

but right now i'm real close to saying fuck it all. to everything.

i'm not going to preach but the basics are i've been raised well. i have amazing parents/family who've raised me with nothing but love and given me everything i've needed to flourish in life.

i have a good profession which i exceled at and become well respected for. i had my own buisness  at the age of 25. i was on the way to success  my ex partner legally took £27,000  and put an end to that.

i live in a criminally driven area. in turn it sucked me in at the age of 14. i've been arrested 17 times in total for numerous reasons. been a heavy cannabis user since the age of 14 and a cocaine user since 21. 

attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge whilst off my face and whiskey and cocaine... obvioualy didn't work just hurt a lot. 

i have reached the point where i'm contemplating what's left in life for me... i've experienced so many different thrills and pleasures fulfilled my fantasies and guilty pleasures  in life from the age of 16 to now that i feel there's nothing left for me.

(i carry that with me everywhere yet always refuse to talk about exactly what it is and where i went so horribly wrong.) but it would give me a chance to feel safe. the hardest part would be cutting off all my friends and family. real good people too. so respectable too. there's no way i was brought up where in any world it was acceptable to do what i did. not that i deserve any good that comes my way. i feel so disgusting i don't even put in good health. i broke my ceiling light trying to hang from it, and i just can't take the strain of what i've done anymore. i'm nothing but vermin that unnecessarily takes up space on earth. once people have discovered the truth, as it's floating out there, dangerously close to my social circles too, and words do travel. people speak up. i know once it's out there and i've gone through with killing myself properly, no-one will miss me. i overshadow the good i do in life with something so terrible it puts me in a spot beyond redemption. where people will all agree just how much of a deplorable and revolting case i am. i'm terrified to go on living. i can't run away without running into myself. i am not overreacting or overthinking when i say this is something bad. and i deserve to die by fire because of it. my closest friend who i semi-opened up to (without stating exactly what it is.) seems to think it's not how it is in my mind, but she's dead wrong. i am so scared about the future. the past is a disgrace. and i can't enjoy the present. i feel my only option is death at this point.",suicide,suicide,1.0

 i came up with a one year plan to do as little damage as possible. briefly, i will slowly remove myself from their lives. take longer and longer for me to answer their sms / phone calls. then i will inform them that i am moving abroad to help other people. where it becomes easier to distance from family and friends and easy to blame for poor connection. this means that i lose contact completely with my family and friends and can finally take my life.

* i can't go back to my country of origin because i would likely (almost certainly) be taken by the army. 
* i don't want to go to the army.
* also, i wouldn't last a minute with access to a firearm with live ammunition.
* so i'm stuck in a bullshit job in a shitty country without any way to get out of either
* i have no valuable skills, abilities or anything worth mentioning
* i've been in this situation for a year but i haven't been able to find another job or a solution 
* i've reached a point where i'm just so tired of everything and i no longer care about what my family would think, or how unhappy they'd feel. i just don't care about any of that any more. besides, isn't it selfish to expect someone to cling on to a miserable existence because their absence would be too difficult for you?

why does no one ever want a future with me? the first said he didn't see us being together. you said you weren't ready for the kind of committment i wanted. all the others just faded away after getting what they wanted from me. just a warm body.

i think about doing it. ending it all. and i feel calm wash over me. i wouldnt be such a burden to anyone anymore. they might be sad for a little bit but then theyd all forget about me soon enough. he'll find someone better and he'll marry her instead and have babies with her and i will be but a distant memory.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm am going reach the post teenager age shortly. wanted to say something. first of all ignore my flair if it says 18. as i grow older i grow less in touch with tech and i've forgotten how to change my flair lol.

anyway, so back to the point at hand. i've been thinking about my final message for a while and what advice i want to bring. i took a long look at my time as a teenager in high school and the beginning of college, and i realize that i've made a lot of mistakes, but also many good decisions. i initially planned on talking about things like relationships, drugs, money, working, and school, because i wanted to convey helpful messages.

however, i realized that none of my story matters to you.

your life is only meant to be experienced by you. you are going to make a lot of mistakes, you are going to experience setbacks, you are likely to experience a lot of pain. and you'll learn from every single one. i hope you understand that right now, you're living exactly as you're supposed to be, even if it doesn't feel like that right now. some of you, perhaps even most of you, are feeling sad or are even depressed. which is sad. and hard. and makes you want to give up sometimes. however, believe me when i tell you that you will emerge from this stronger. someday you'll look back on that person you used to be and be so glad that you changed for the better.

keep living. keep grinding. keep redditing.

"my mother really wants me to not have sex. so i guess for context, my mom conceived me having sex out of wedlock with my dad (without a fucking condom) when she was just under 18 years old. she's had some bad experiences with women all throughout her life. her mom was abusive, she went to with some girls that she hated. probably most recently, she's gotten cheated on. a couple of times with the father of my half-siblings and literally 23 times with the person she dated after him. so just a whole bunch of bad experiences have her basically assume that all females are whores and she kind of projects on me.

 anytime i like a girl, first question she asks is ""is she a whore?"" and my answer is always no because i don't like people that seem like they hoe around, and then if she hears something she doesn't quite like about a girl i like she automatically assumes she's a whore anyway. the only girl she's ever found out that i like and approved of was my now ex-girlfriend. to say the least the thing she liked about her was that in our 4 month relationship we never even held hands. and i kind of hated it. and it wasn't like she had personality to make up for it.

it's hard to find a girl like that, and i don't even want to find a girl like that but i feel like i have to because of my freaking mother who has anything to make up for it with their personality. and my mother doesn't seem to know this but i'm a particularly sexual person. my favorite jokes are dirty ones and dark ones. generally i'm just kind of a horny motherfucker. it's very hard to find a girl who isn't like this (because my mom would flip out) that is also comfortable with hearing this type of stuff. i want to find a girl like me but my mom would instantly disapprove.

i currently have a crush on a girl who i can just be myself with, warts and all without judgement and she can act the same with me and i really like her personality and she's attractive and she told me she loved me yesterday (honestly i'm not sure what to think of that at all.) my mother disapproves though, because she thinks i might have a chance at having sex with her. and as a 14 year old boy i think my mom technically has the right to do this. 

my problem is that she wants me to save myself until marriage and she has told me she will kick my ass if i have sex with anybody before marriage. i plan on waiting until like my twenties or even thirties to get hitched. i also like kind of want to have sex with the person i marry before i marry them regardless. i honestly believe i will know when the time is right and when i'm with the right person have sex with.

what bothers me is that anytime i've really liked a girl and my mom knew about it she disapproved. i almost feel like my mom has like detectors for if i'm passionate about someone at all and it's a red flag to her if she can tell that i feel some level of passion toward a girl. let's be real i didn't feel particularly passionate toward my ex-girlfriend and i think it showed. before her i had a really big crush on a girl, and some of my friends even pointed out that it seemed like i liked the girl before my ex more than i liked my ex and while we were dating i denied it in my mind, but it's true. 

and i feel like my mom can detect how much i like a girl maybe just from my tone of voice while talking about her. my mom gets kind of narcissistic about this, but she really is smart and she can read people well and i bet it comes across to her as a red flag if it seems like i really like someone.

honestly the reason i started typing all of this though is that i just want to get some opinions on if my mother has the right to make me preserve myself until marriage even after i'm an adult.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"life going nowhere...i'll just start by saying i'm not a very bright individual at all. sure i graduated high school with over 4.0 gpa and got into and graduated from college but that is about the extent of my intelligence. in college i had no idea what i wanted to be. heck, even now i still have no idea. but anyways, i eventually graduated with a bachelor's degree an averagely average cumulative gpa of about 3.0. i graduated from college about two years go now and have been jobless ever since.

since i had no job lined up after graduation i was basically forced (or strongly encouraged i guess) to move back home which i ended up doing since it made the most financial sense. my dad claimed that he could line up a job for me within three months. three months go by, lo and behold, still no job. fast forward to now, still no job. between then and now though i've essentially been forced to take more classes at a community college and volunteer at an elementary school. now, i understand that this is a pretty good use of time as that way i won't be seen as just being idle when i apply to jobs but i honestly have no strong desire to do either. i should also mention that of course i have been applying to jobs on my own and have even had a handful of interviews but i never got any of them. i'm convinced it is mostly due to my lack of experience. as i said before, i'm not very bright and as a result, have never worked a single day in my life. not even retail/fast food during high school or college. not a very smart move, i know. now even places like target and best buy won't take me. i'm stuck in that position where nobody will take me because i don't have enough experience or i'm too overqualified. internships are also usually unpaid and as a result require that you are in school which is kind of problematic. not to mention i don't live near any major cities so internship opportunities are slim to begin with anyways. i would have to move to a different city but obviously moving for an unpaid internship isn't exactly the greatest idea if i don't want to bleed money.

additionally, my social interaction has been reduced to a minimum. everyone i know or used to know is pursuing graduate school or working by now. i was also pretty stupid in not forming more connections during my time in college. in fact, if anything i probably ended up burning a lot of bridges. so i basically haven't hung out with anyone in person for the longest time. i do have interactions with friends online though which keeps me sane.

i'm pretty much at wit's end now. i have contemplated suicide before and even saw a campus counselor during my last year in college but honestly, i have been like this for a few years now. i don't know how i'm still alive but i am, for now.

tl;dr jobless college graduate with no real goals, life kinda being directed for me now. pretty much only a few friends left which even then is just online conversations. what is the point of being alive if i have nothing to look forward to? i feel completely and utterly useless since everyone around me is on their way to being independent and successful.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i live in my headim a 15 year old tranny faggot with a bad case of the ""dumb crisis"", using my ""main"" because i need to get over myself and my fears because dumb, talk about that in the future if i'm here just start the damn post please thanks just stop

i live in my head, in my own delusion and it hurts because i know it'll never be real and the people who i love there arent real. i know that my asshole of lovable friends won't be real and anything i we do together isn't real.

like i damn pretend to hang out with them or we actually go out and just walk and talk together because we're chill, we fucking cosplay and make jokes about weird stuff on the internet, everyone has their own personality and life and understanding of things. like i can just talk to them and they're real but they're not and i want to stop so bad

the stuff i do with those friends is then posted online because ""haha funneh"" and it gets made into compilations (e.g. \[someone's\] funniest moments) so i get the excuse of thinking about specific scenes, i run around making jokes to myself and i laugh at myself to simulate someone else. i play games with myself but pretend there's a player 2 and we're having fun together. i scream and choke/cough so much alone because i run out of breath trying to pace and talk at the same time. it's not helped by the fact i'm borderline anorexic.

i made up someone to love me just because i can't stop wanting to be hugged by someone, i just want tell someone i love them and hear it back. i hug myself to try and feel like it's real but it never will be. i lie in bed and just dream of someone cuddling me and just saying ""it's going to be okay, i'm here for you"" but you're not and never will be. you'll never be real and i'll never hug you, you'll never wipe away my stupid tears and call me a dummy for crying and then proceed to make fun of me for laughs and make those tears go away.

i feel like if i die then i can just live there and be free of my loop, and by loop i literally pace in the same spot every single day thinking about this fantasy of a life, i feel like i can't get across to my psychiatrist of how toxic my mental state is, i feel like i can't get anything across without breaking into tears. even when someone texts me and i feel like there ""tone"" is unusual/not the same i say sorry. i say sorry for everything because i can't afford to lose the real connections i some how made, i don't know how to make new ones because i'm to much of a pussy to talk first because i feel like existing is bothering people. i refuse to call 000 (911) because i don't think i'm worth their time. 

i want to die so bad because i feel like then i can get out of this lonely place i'm in. 2020 is my last year to find a purpose outside of my head but so far i've got nothing. i have no one who would care if i was gone. family no, real friends, no, i just sit on the sidelines most of the time. but they still say they care about me but for some reason i believe in the friends in my head so much more. i believe that one day my life will be like just how it is in my thoughts. i don't want to be famous, i just want to be loved by someone and make jokes

i would talk about everything in my world, real and fake but if i don't finish something, i'll never post this and never get help and i just want to stop pretending and face the facts that i just have to deal with what i have. i will never have friends who will ever do anything like that, i'll never be an animator and i'll never be happy as i was in my thoughts

i just need to hit post and stop thinking, i want to be dead, i'm to scared even to post this but i need someone/anyone real to hear it and just slap me. it's to the point where i complain about this way of thinking to the fake people i'm thinking of. i'm worried i'll fully forget whats real and whats fake, i have already began getting confused, i just dont want it to get to the point where i believe they are real and i get put on a news paper for everyone to go ""glad i'm not that guy"" and live in their real world

i just want a purpose, a reason to keep putting up with this, just an ending

i feel like i'll have to give myself my own ending, my death is something that i can control and it's gotten to me. i could end it all if i wanted but paranoia hits hard, and so can my anti depressents. i feel like they don't do anything, so honestly i just should lie to myself

"i feel numbi guess my story starts when i was about 12 years old. i started to self harm and knew i didn't want to be alive anymore. as i continued to grow up i promised myself i would never let myself live in pain the way i was for the rest of my shitty life.

the depression comes and goes, but it always finds a way back to me. you know when you love someone, and you don't know how you can survive without them? my depression treats me like that, an abusive relationship that gets better and then hits full in dragging me down further each time.

i can find a little bit of happiness and a little bit of meaning to my life. i can start to feel good and realize i'm really not that great of a person. i'm awful, and yes i would leave people behind, but to be honest they are far better off. 

i think constantly about  how i could end my pathetic pointless life. i can't get a gun, but i'm also not down for just slicing my arms open in a bathtub (rules of attraction). 

i guess what lauched me the hardest this time is the fact that anytime i feel for someone i get hurt. i fall in love and start to feel normal, and it just ends. i haven't felt for someone in years, and i've known this person since we were children.

i just wish i knew what was wrong with me. what i could fix to make me more likable, attractive, funny. i wish i knew what was wrong with me where no one can love me back.

i made a plan a while ago to end my life on october 13th, and it made sense to me. it felt right, and this asshole comes in and makes me feel like there might be hope,  and reminds me i'm shit.

i can't kill myself on the next friday the 13th in april because a family members birthday  is too close to that date and that person means too much to hurt them like that. 

i have this october or almost a year to decide if i want this life anymore. the thing is i've given my life so many chances and i've tried to change my life and it's still awful. i'm still alone and yeah i have a few people that give a fuck about me, but i'll never get married or have friends that relate to me.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i hate my life, i hate being a burden and i hate that i am so weird.i found out that i have ms last year and since then, it's been a downhill battle. i can no longer drive, i can't work and i don't have the strength i once had, even walking can be a struggle. not only that but, women run away as fast as they meet me, and i am way too weird, i just don't know how to turn it off. i have no social life anymore and was forced to move in with my mother. i don't go on dates anymore because i feel like i'm catfishing. the reason i say that is because, when i go on a date, at the end of the date women will ask where i parked and i end up telling them the truth, that i can't drive and my mom dropped me off. 10% of the women i date seem cool with it, the other 90% say, thanks for dinner, give me a hug and i never hear from them again. i hate living like this, i hate feeling so alone, i hate being unable to do the things someone my age would do, and i hate waking up knowing that nothing is going to change. i'm 30 years old and i have no future, i have no income, and i know there isn't a women in this world that would want me. i honestly feel like ron in harry potter in this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndd4unpib0o except for what hermione says about ron is what the truth is for me. there isn't a women in the world who would want to deal with someone like me, and that okay because i don't want to hurt anyone, or become a burden to anyone else and that seems like all i can do these days. the only reason i haven't killed myself as of yet is for my family, but taking away the burden that is me would help them more than it hurts them.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i wrote a poem for my boyfriend’s birthday. his birthday is still sometime away so i wanna make sure that’s it’s good and not too cheesy the universe is as infinite as we can imagine

just maybe

this doesn’t matter

someone can care for someone else

"i don't feel like i'm getting better anymore?i started therapy at the beginning of this year (around early february). i can't tell if it's helping. my boyfriend of almost a few years has been incredibly supporting and genuinely says that he's noticed it's helping me a lot. and at first i really liked it. but now... idk it doesn't feel as satisfying to confide in my therapist. the main reason i went was because i didn't want to burden my boyfriend with everything going on in my life. 

my dad died at a young age. my older brother died a few years later. my mom used to be physically abusive after they died (feels it's normal bc of her culture), but now she's just emotionally/verbally abusive. i have to depend on her for car rides. it's the most humiliating thing. i do have a job and i'm good at saving money. but we don't have the most stable financial situation since my dad died. and she's incredibly demeaning and she knows that i need her to get to get to school and even my fucking therapy. i could uber but it would take out a lot from my paycheck, and my boyfriend is very against it because of safety reasons. my boyfriend drives me a lot and i pay him for gas but i still feel terrible about it. i almost have enough for a decent car. so hopefully this changes soon.

i have a part-time job i actually like and i'm currently taking 18 units at community college with almost a 4.0... i'm grateful for everything and especially my boyfriend and my friends. but i just on and off keep feeling.... empty. on my 19th birthday this year i seriously really considered killing myself. and my boyfriend knows i've had those thoughts and it devastated him. he doesn't know i still have those feelings now though (half a year later).

i told my mom i had depression. she said it made her uncomfortable and ""it wasn't really a thing back in her country"". (i lived in that country as a toddler). never once asked how i feel or if i was okay. she lectured me on how it made her feel then demanded an apology at the end. yes, an apology for showing my depression.

i just never feel good enough. like my mom said, i have good grades, a good relationship, and am i guess conventionally attractive so i have no reason to feel depressed.... but i just hate myself.... i reallt feel disgusted by myself.

most times when i'm with my boyfriend i think ""i'm glad i'm still alive"". he always sincerely tells me he loves me, how happy i make him, and how he wants to marry me when we're older. i really feel the same way. i know it sounds pathetic but if i didn't have him i'd rather be dead. (i would never ever tell him that). i just don't feel like i should be alive. i wish i died instead of my brother. i wish i didn't have panic attacks over dumb shit. i'm trying so hard to better myself. i changed my lifestyle to be healthier. maybe i'm just being impatient. sometimes i look up ''most painless ways to die"" but i don't think i'd ever do it for the sake of my boyfriend and it would be pretty cruel to add to another death in the family. 

i don't know what to do. i hate living with my family. i've been told they'd be happier without me. my mom always says i'm her least favorite and that i ruin everything. i don't make enough money to move out, and i can't afford the school i want to transfer to... i guess i'll keep doing therapy. i'm afraid to take antidepressants because of the side effects. i just feel so empty sometimes and convince myself i don't deserve to be alive. but sometimes it's like nothing is wrong. i can't tell if i'm getting better... i want to be normal :(. i have so many mixed feelings. inside i know i want to keep living and get better. it just feels like i'm stuck right now..",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i dont know why i botheri'm 22 now and ever since i was 16 probably i came to the realization that i was worthless. that was about the time i came out of my shell at school and started to be a little more confident. turns out that people hated that part of me. apparently what i thought was me coming out of my shell was apparently me just being an ""annoying little shit"". i had one really good friend in high school that i probably will really miss a whole lot because he is actually the best. but most of the people i hung out with made my life hell. every recess/lunch every time i'd speak up i was told to shut up telling and given this stupid nickname which was ""so funny"". they called me ""turdtool"" which was such a great play on words because it sounded like turtle. i probably brought it on myself. i don't know i thought i was fine but i guess if everyone thought it was the case then i must just really be a little shit. it got worse whenever harri went away for basketball or was sick that day. harri was always the one person who was never mean to me even though i probably annoy him to. whenever he wasn't there to back me up my ""friends"" would dump water on me or knock me around a lot as well as the constant insults. 

family life wasn't a huge amount better. i have 7 siblings and it always seems like i am the one getting into fights and causing problems. it didn't matter who it was i'd probably fought a lot with them. basically my family all thinks i am an immature troublemaker which gives me even more reason to think it would be better if i was gone.

 the best part of my life used to be work. i was happy at my casual job at kfc. i worked hard and i stayed quiet mostly. i even ended up being so good at my job that the store manager personally requested i became a manager (what a ""great"" achievement) but since the i have moved towns for uni and started at a new store. i don't really fit in here and i found out the other day was that i am one of the least favorite managers here because i am ""not fun at all"". 

i have no ""real"" friends in newcastle. i still keep in touch with harri but he is 500km away and we basically only talk when playing games. i thought i did but one of the people i thought was a good friend was talking to me the other day and told me that he wouldn't say that i am a ""friend friend"" and more just someone he plays games with.

one if the only reasons i am still here is harri. every day i think i annoy him more and more and i am just waiting for the time when he gets sick of me and wants to break off our friendship. i want to tell him all of this but i don't want to be a burden to him because he is great but super busy. he has a full time job and uni to deal with and that can't be easy for him. 

people always say that suicide is selfish because you are leaving so many people behind and they will all miss you. i doubt many people would miss me. my parents and siblings probably and then harri. that's why i can't but it's so hard my parents are super critical of things i do and i just want to tell them to ease up a bit but they say they just want the best for me. i just don't want to keep fighting and i want it all to end.

as it's progressed i went from contemplating suicide once every few weeks to thinking about it everyday. i just feel like i am ruining everybody's life, including my own, if i don't. i cry for seemingly no reason because i don't want to tell people that i'm thinking about suicide. the thought of ending my life doesn't make me happy but life doesn't make me happy either. i don't even have a lot to be upset about; i have a good home life, i have a boyfriend that loves me, i got accepted into the college of my dreams but none of that seems to matter and it makes me feel worse.



i get really upset for what seems like nothing and i can't help it. the smallest piece of stress will cause me to jump straight into a suicidal mindset. i think about killing myself when i'm at school, at home, at work, in the car... everywhere. i have written note after note trying to build the courage to just end it but i can't. so all i'm asking is that someone can give me some advice on how to tell my mom (i still live at home) because i don't want to hurt her but i also want to stop hurting myself by not getting help. i've been scared to tell her for too long and i need some help.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"time to end my little pity party.hey, all. i've had a few weeks that have been really kicking my ass. 

long story short, i'm a single mom of three who's husband lost his life to suicide due to ptsd just over a year ago. i'm 29, we'd been together since i was 15 and he was, without a doubt, my truest friend, my greatest love, and the world's best dad. i know i told him that every day which is something i'm thankful for daily now. 

when my husband first got really sick, i started eating adderall by the handful to try to keep up. one day, i decided to try meth. i never let my completely fall victim to the devil that is methamphetamine, but i did more damage than i'd ever like to admit. i'm sober now, working my program, parenting my babies and being present again. but that isn't to say i didn't royally f*** my life up, and during my addiction, my drivers license was suspended. i still have three kids schedules to keep up with, two full time jobs and my treatment program.  i don't have any family or public transport where i live so (although i know its wrong), i drive my personal truck to all of these things daily. i try to counteract this by keeping the best of the best insurance on my truck and follow the rules of the road to a t. 

i was pulled over for a brake light being out last month, it was discovered that i didn't have a license, and my truck was towed (by the grace of god, this was the only punishment of the ordeal). but i couldn't afford the tow bill even just for one day, let alone the 4 days my truck sat in impound.  i have no family, the va didn't give a flying f*** when i lost my husband, nor were we offered any help, and i'm still rebuilding my life after damn near losing it to the loss of my husband and subsequent addiction. i had no one to help me pay the $440 impound bill, except someone i had met in na a few months prior, and the only person i considered my real friend. 

long story short, friend agreed to help pay the bill as long as the title was signed over (to be returned upon my repaying the $440) and the truck was kept in their possession during the repayment period. no problem. 

except.. that's not what happened. ""friend"" saw this as an easy way to obtain ownership of a $9500 truck (that is what was offered to me in cash at a dealership one day. i was desperate and weighing my options, but decided against parting with it. the truck belonged to my husband, it was his truck since age 17, we shared our first kiss in it, and he loved it as much as he loved our kids. every once in awhile i could smell his cologne in there and so i, in turn, loved the truck as much as one could possibly love anything material in life) and decided to keep the truck. 

i was stunned. i should've known better but i just never thought it would happen like that, and after offering ""friend"" $400, $800 and finally $1200 (i sold my wedding ring.. i can't quite swallow that yet), he still refused to return the truck. so i panicked, took my spare keys and stole it. 

i just spent almost 3 weeks in jail for my decision. i missed thanksgiving with my kids, i lost my job and if convicted of this felony, i will spend a year in prison (i have a stay of adjudication for a prior felony charge, an assault charge i earned when i was begging the va to save my husband's life). 

but you know what? i am okay. i really am. i sit back and i know i've survived worse and i could face worse in the future but i'm not high. i can feel god here with me. my babies are perfect and healthy and i'm struggling with everything (finances being the one that feels like it might drown me) but for some reason, i have peace. i am praying for that same peace for all of you tonight. i'm sorry for whatever you are struggling with now and am cheering you on towards a better future. my husband would have just looked at me and laughed right now and said ""well...fuck"". and that's where i am now, too. well, fuck. 2020 was rough but god damn i tried. i know i did and i know i did right by my babies and that is all that counts. i'm sober, i'm alive, i was blessed with 11 years of the best human being to ever walk this earth aside from jesus christ. i miss you, baby. sure could use you right now but god needed you more so that's that. merry chrismas, guys. i hope you don't feel so damn alone.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

"should i kill myself before or after the school play?well, i've made peace with my death, have begun saying my goodbyes, and feel that i'm ready. i have irreparably ruined my life. i am now completely alone. i can't even really feel sad anymore, not angry either. i've given up. they broke me. this world has broken me down and i can't fight it anymore. as my method of suicide, i have chosen to allow myself to be hit by a speeding vehicle. now, my only question is whether i simply do that tonight and end all of our suffering now, redeem myself, and regain my honor. or do i wait a week until the play has passed and then do it. don't say wait a week in the hopes that i will change my mind, i will not. however, i don't want to fuck up the play. still, my part is small enough that it likely won't make much of an impact, my absence. essentially, my question is, in a strange sense, do i want to die with or without saying goodbye. there's this one person in particular who has been there for me, who i do care for. it's funny, i've reached a point where, even if she did care for me the same, it wouldn't change my mind anymore. this is my destiny. i don't know whether or not i should say goodbye to her. i don't want her to feel guilty or even sad, she deserves to be happy. would it hurt more if i end things without saying goodbye, or should i say it?",suicide,suicide,1.0

she said “we’re turning off the cameras so it’ll only be audio. just confess you have a problem” and i said “what problem?” 

she leaped on to me and that’s when i woke up to her on my chest looking at me face to face and screaming “confess” in a raspy voice. her tongue was hanging out and i was scared it was gonna go down my throat.

leonardo dicaprio is extremely rich and he's also incredibly good looking. there are plenty of women who'd date him. 

the youngest girl he's dated has been 18, that was when he was 24. 6 years?? what's so weird in that? that's a pretty normal difference

if i was 46 years old, had billions of dollars, incredibly good looks, and on top of that had millions of people of all ages who want to date me i'd also probably pick girls in their 20s

being an adult means you're supposed to make your own decisions
all these girls made their decision to date a guy who could afford anything he wants
so what's the issue? 

if he'd been grooming all these girl from a young age then obviously it makes sense to get justice 


drake on the other hand

there's a difference of 17 years between them

millie bobby brown is fucking 15
drake is 32

if millie bobby brown had been 30 and drake 47 then that wouldn't be weird

she's in her teenage years. teenagers have no idea what's good for them and what's not
adults are supposed to show them the right path 

we're told in schools that we should talk to a trusted adult if we ever need help 


i'm currently 14 and if a 30 year old ever tries to text me such casually i'd fucking run to my parents crying

i some how got an email from a drafting company through indeed, asking me to apply to their company.   i was ecstatic.  that's what i went to college for.  they said they would train me. awesome salary and benefits.  i did my assessment this week, and what was a quick back and fourth turned into radio silence.   they probably called the lowe's i worked for, and learned i walked out.  i deserve it, i fucked that up.   i can't help but think what could have been though.   i wouldn't have to go to bed hungry most nights.    i could afford to properly fix my car, or hell even buy a new one.   i would be able to save money for retirement.  i could stay up late and see my friends again most nights.   i could watch football again.     but it's not going to happen.  that's when the thoughts began.  

they only turned for worse yesterday with the kavanaugh crap.   i don't like admitting this, but i voted for trump.   back then i was an angry, vitriolic nazi.  i hated minorities and women.   i was a piece of shit.  it just felt so nice being accepted for once.   i've always been an outcast, but here comes this group of people saying 'welcome', and i fell for it.  

 luckily, since then, i've met some amazing people and slowly my poor world views turned around.   however, my hand helped put one of the final nails in the coffin of this glorious nation.   i love this country, i really do, but it's dead now.   trump is going to win reelection, and we'll have a conservative court for the next couple of decades.  i was going to go into the military to try and get out of my shitty situation, but what's the point now?  what is there to fight for?  what is there to die for?  our society is fragmented and probably irreparable.  people can't see the bigger picture.  the dumbing down of america has succeeded.   i don't think we can go back.

"my last act will be giving my abusive family and ex-fiancee a body to wake up to on christmas day. i am a kind, sensitive person but have no cares left to give.i just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before i die tonight. why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? my self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where i can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.

when i was eight my dad died from cancer and i was raised by a single mother. from the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. she constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me i was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (""my life would be so much better if you were never born""). when i was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. i would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. i have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. she is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.

i was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. the one thing i still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. i left school with straight a grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside ivy league universities in world rankings. i wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but i didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. just before i left for college i went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. it was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and i must have looked a lot more popular than i was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. she approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. it was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. 

i have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her i loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. i just couldn't get her out of my mind. that christmas she introduced me to her family and i saw what a real family is for the first time. loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. the next year was like a dream. she took me to europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. the second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. i was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. i trusted only her. by the time exams came around i was in such a terrible state i turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. i did that and tried to get better. i tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. i was in my twenties and had never had a job, i felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.

i returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. the only reason i graduated was that i chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as i knew one exam would be too much pressure. instead i had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. 

i was so lost and embarrassed in life, i had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. i deleted almost everyone from social media because i couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the us. again, it was incredible. i asked her why the hell she was with me. she told me i was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together i would finally be able to build the confidence i needed to succeed. she truly believed in me after all that time. i asked her to marry me. she said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as i had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. she graduated in august and we moved in together in september. she started working at a nearby hospital and i went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. i planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. from september 1st to november 1st this year i no longer had depression. i was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. i was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. then she left me. she knew everything i'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. i travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. 

she has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. these last two months have been insufferable. we still sleep in the same bed. all i wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that i'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights i can't help but beg. she has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. she says i'm not a real man, i'm not funny, i'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. i guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and i made her laugh all the time. she doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and i have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but i can't afford to live anywhere else and i can't go back to my mum's house. it's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. she says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. they are *my* family too at this point but i'm not allowed near the house. her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. i haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. now i have to go and spend christmas with a family i thought i'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years. fuck that. i simply will not do this anymore. i cannot spend another day in this horrible fucking world.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"sand sculpture revenge ok so i just remembered this story from 2 years back, when i was at the beach. i love making sculptures out of sand even though they turn out pretty lame. 

so i was at the beach enjoying my day with nothing to worry about, making a sand-man (snowman but with sand) kind of thing. i even put sticks as the arms and some shells as hair. he was a handsome young man. while i was washing my hands, after looking for some shells, i saw these dudes who walked up to my sand-man (sandy from here) and just kicked it. like kicked it as if he had done something wrong to them. sand and shells flew everywhere-is what it looked like. from my eyes, i watched sandy's insides come out. all his guts and organs flew around in every direction possible, all while the dudes where laughing. i had the sudden urge to go and mess with them. but as the good boy i am, and didn't. 

 i walked up to sandy and promised a blood oath of vengeance. only sandy's head was buried that day...

so, i put my brain into overdrive. i decide to build another one, sandy pt. ii. but this sandy was not like the other. it was stronger, faster, more aggressive, and massive. must have come up to 45cm (approx 1.5 ft). sandy pt. ii was built right behind sandy, so that the dudes will be able to see it again. and they did. they walked up to it laughing, and they all started kicking it.

there was a sudden cry of pain from the group. little did they know, i had actually implanted as many stones with sharp edges i could find inside sandy pt. ii. 2 of them started bleeding.

the drops of blood that fell on that spot that day, was sandy's revenge. it also stands as a mark- a reminder if you will, that pain befalls those who crushes sand sculptures.

"i committed my partneron sunday night, my partner of 6 years and i had an argument. this is maybe the 5th fight we've ever had. it was about how he was treating me when he drinks too much. he just turns into a jerk and acts like a frat boy. i was getting ready to fall asleep on the couch and i heard the kitchen knife leave the counter. then the bathroom door closes and locks. one of our cats started meowing and clawing the door. i had to break in and i found him, fully clothed, in the bathtub full of water with the knife at his arm. i took the knife, got him into dry clothes and called my dad. my partner tells me that he thought he heard me say that it would be easier if he were dead. so he thought that by killing himself, i would get the insurance money and be set (none of which i said or wanted). my dad stayed on the line with me while my mom called 911. the cops showed up, hand cuffed him (he was 100% cooperative) and threw him in the back of the cop car (i'll be writing a letter of complaint for their actions). finally, 2.5 hours after the incident i was allowed to see him in the er. the nurse told me that his blood alcohol level was at 0.2. his last drink was over three hours before that. i stayed with him all night. he was admitted to a facility the next morning and is still there till at least thursday. he is a brilliant man with a great career as a software developer and has an internal drive to succeed. his current psychologist has told him everything i've already told him. he is too self critical and needs to learn how to shut his brain down. he is cooperating and accepting the help. they don't believe he is ""crazy"" but had hit his breaking point and snapped.

but what do i do? he doesn't blame me or my parents for putting him there. i have tried to stay strong and be as supportive and loving as i can. but i just am lost. what are the next steps? what can i do to help him further once he's released? any advice is helpful and appreciated.",suicide,suicide,1.0

the same facilities where i was almost strangled to death by an ex-con in the bathroom. the same facilities where i saw a man stabbed through the arm, and another beaten black and blue by the orderly. there is no healing in those places.   

people treat me like freak for struggling with ptsd. my friends distance themselves from me, my neighbors mock me, and my adoptive family cut almost all ties years ago. my therapists talks to me like a child and tells me to just cope indefinitely.

"this is the first time i'm asking for helpi've had really bad break down yesterday and it's carrying on today. i've tried to fake it and forced myself to feel better but as i'm laying here trying to sleep i just feel overwhelmed with sadness. i've never felt so low in my life. i thought i was better. at the beginning of the year i started working out. i lost 20 pounds already, felt more confident in myself. ive tried to socialize more, even though i still feel awkward and i get anxiety. but for some reason i still feel sad. 

and my birthday is coming up this friday, and it's making things worse.

i wrote a letter in the event of my death and i have it tied to my gmail to send it to people i trust and to post it on my social media accounts. 

*life is like a boat. i don't know what that means, i just know that i've always wanted to start a speech off like that. given the circumstances, this might be the only chance i have. if you're reading this, then i'm already dead.

it's not your fault. it's not anyone's fault really, so if you blame yourself, please don't. if anyone's to blame, then i only have myself at fault.

i've thought about this for a very long time. i thought about what i'd say, give a reason to what i did, or to leave behind some meaning to the people that might care. i've played this message over and over again in my mind, since it's the last thing you'd ever hear from me. in the end i just wanted to keep it simple.

hi, my name is seeds_of_love. and this is goodbye. i've been struggling with trying to find meaning in my life for a while now. i've dreamed of doing great things, to be remembered and talked about for ages to come. but that's not going to happen. there's nothing great or memorable about me. so i sought out love, that if i had someone to live for then that's enough. for a while i did, and i thought that was enough. but i was foolish and i made one of the biggest mistakes of my life and let her go. 

i've never felt so lonely in my life. i didn't have a best friend to talk to, to make me feel better. i didn't have a shoulder to cry on but my own. and there were nights i wish i had someone to hear me cry. 

i'm just a disappointment to everyone around me, i let down anyone who wanted to be around me. and i'm sorry for that.

for a long time i've clung on to hope, and it's been ever fleeting. i keep saying, one more day. just one more day, and something might happen. i'd pray to the heavens above having faith that something will come my way, but nothing hears me. there's nothing there. there's nothing in my future. 

and i've come to a realization. that it's all meaningless, there's nothing to live for. i'm not in pain, just lonely. i'm not hurting or am i sick, just knowing that there's nothing going on just makes me feel empty. i can't imagine my future, i'm not too happy about my present, and my past was forgettable.

i'm not scared of dying. i imagine it is peaceful, liberating even. the stresses of life, deadlines, expectations: burdens suddenly lifted and become meaningless. at the end of the day, i won't regret going to work one more day, slaving away my finite time to causes i care nothing about. i won't regret waiting in lines to fit in a society that doesn't care about the impoverished, the helpless, the wayward souls. i will come to regret not having one more day with the ones i love. i regret not having one more day with the one i loved. i regret not having one more day with my favorite people in the world, the ones i found worth living for. but they don't need me anymore. their happiness is independent of me. and i'm thankful for that. 

i don't fear death. it's an inevitability, for all things. i will regret not seeing a future full of wonder, a brighter future where everyone is happy. i will regret the pain that my death will cause. i don't fear death, i fear how my death will affect the ones i care about. i've had a near death experience once i believe. the feeling wasn't dread or regret. i was at ease. serenity. i saw a tree in a garden so beautiful, so bright. paradise. i don't fear death, as death is not something to be afraid of. it's welcoming, it's not dark or sinister. death is not evil, it just is.  i know the feeling of losing someone, or something. grandparents, friends, pets, strangers. and i don't wish to ever feel that pain again. i'm sorry to those that i cause pain to. just know that i'm at peace, and i'm happier in this state. 

this isn't a cry for help, it's just saying goodbye. because if you're reading this, for you there's probably meaning. i just couldn't find my own, and that's okay. i'm okay, i'm going to be okay. you, could be my friend, or family, or a complete stranger. i don't know who you are, but i just want you to know, i love you. from the bottom of my heart, more than anything in the world. it's the last thing i can give to you truly. i love you.

take care.

"i can't deal with the sadness after breaking up with my 1st girlfirendi broke up with my girlfriend after 6 months of relationship. i'm 17 and we are in the same class. we just weren't good for each other. too much things that made us different. i tried not to be too sad about it. five days after breakup i found out that my best friend was kissing with her at the party. it felt like train hit me. now looking at her, smelling her perfumes and talking to her makes me even more depressed. i miss her, i just want to kiss her again. i want to end my life.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"im transhonestly i've had mental health issues since i was very young, it's not something i've had diagnosed but the anxiety i feel when doing menial things like _going outisde_ or being unable to talk on the phone is something i've been feeling for longer than i can remember. 

now that i'm older i've also learned that my family has a history of mental health issues, my brother has a personality disorder and struggled with self harm, my dad has an anxiety disorder and has substance abuse problems and my auntie had serious substance abuse issues throughout her early adult life because she was trying to kill herself, so really it feels like i've been setup to feel like this. 

in high school when i was 13 i started self harming and at 15 i tried to kill myself. no one knew about the suicide except for a *then* close friend. however the school had noticed my behaviour and my mum was called and i was assigned a councillor. i went twice and quit and no one ever followed up on it. even my mum just told me i was being stupid. this was also a time where both my best friends ghosted me, and i never spoke to them again specifically because of the self harming. 

fast forward to 19 and i'm having identity problems, and sexuality issues which puts a strain on my relationship with my ex. we break up and 2 years later i come out to my family and friends as transgender - and my mum is just fine with it. but no matter how many times i beg her to help me, she refuses and won't take me to the doctor's. 

i'm 21 and i essentially run away, i've lost all my friends where i live, my dad is a waster and my mother refuses to help me. so i move to england where some of my internet/work friends live and life is good .. for a while ... it starts again, i have arguments or just mood swings and i start cutting again. it's pretty obvious because my wrists are covered and my flat mates do nothing, no conversations or anything. they just don't care. i've begged my close friend here to take me to the doctor's, i've even offered him money but he also refuses despite the fact i am literally _mutilating myself_ in our flat. ive even asked what gp(doctor's) to go to because i don't know how it works but they don't even reply to me...

tldr: 
my old friends all left me, the school didn't care, my dad wasn't even in my life, my mum doesn't want to help, and my new friends couldn't care less. and it seems soo silly but i just can't do it myself and i need someone right now but no one cares. it doesn't matter what i do no one fucking cares enough to help - not even my mum. i don't even know what to do now, it's like maybe if i killed myself it would just be easier. it fucking sucks being trans and it fucking sucks being anxious about everything in life.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm just a monsteri always manage to fudge up. and i always try to change myself to become a better person. and i always end up right back at the start.

i'm very socially awkward and have a hard time getting close to people, so i have very few friends. those few friends i do have, i value more than anything. idk where i'd be without them. yet i always end up hurting them one way or another. i misunderstand what they say and then it turns into some argument where i say things i regret and end up apologizing over and over as they ignore my calls and messages. there's only so much of this crap they can take until they give up on me and cut this toxicity out of their lives. i really can't blame them if they do. i don't deserve the patience and care they give me everyday. i'm really shocked they're still sticking with me.

but today i messed up again after a long time of what seemed like improvement. i messed up. i'm awful at putting my feelings into words and it came out wrong and she got hurt and now she won't talk to me and i feel like i don't deserve to live because what sort of monster does?

i cause nothing but pain to other people's lives. i'm a burden to everyone. my mother works so hard everyday to keep me healthy and well-fed, but i'm just a pig who eats up all the food and doesn't do my chores and sits around all day being lazy. she is losing her job in a week and won't be able to pay for my monthly doctor visits. my health is in very poor condition right now and sometimes i pass out.. sometimes i stop breathing.

i've reached the point where maybe dying from my condition is a good thing. my mom wouldn't have to constantly pull together funds for me. my friends wouldn't always have to be hurt by me. i won't have to burden everyone.

i’m turning 21 in a week and a bit so that means i have 4 years left. i’m not afraid of death but i’m afraid of how friends and family will feel when i do die. but i’ve lost a lot of friends in the past year so maybe all of them will be gone by then. 

i’ve lived a lot of my life in my head imagining a perfect life as a means to escape which makes snapping back to reality so painful. i know that realistically in real life i’ll never live the really good lives i’ve made up in my head. i’ve never been in love, i’m not outgoing the way i want to be, i don’t like the way i look, and honestly i don’t see any of that changing. 

i’ve lived a pretty good life, in fact people would be jealous of my life, but i’m still depressed so who’s to say that even if i have that perfect life i’ll be happy? i’ll still be anxious about everything, i’ll still have self esteem issues and i’ll still have my add. 

it kind of nice to know that i only have 4 years left (unless something happens before). this means that i can live my life to the fullest because i know i’m on a deadline. i’ll travel, be more likely to say yes to outings, will care less about how i look because it doesn’t matter, i’ll be gone soon anyways. 

i don’t have to worry about the future because there is none. this deadline as morbid as it sounds feels so freeing. the older you get the more problems you collect and i can’t really see myself in the future being 50 with half a century’s worth of problems.

"my neighbour committed suicide and it's really messing with meas the title says my neighbour hung herself yesterday morning. i wasn't even that close with her yet it is still hitting me pretty hard. she suffered from mental illness for years and unfortunately no one in the neighbourhood knew and to be honest, nobody was really a big fan of her. she wasn't a very nice person, she was a huge narcissist, she manipulated and used people and she never really got over her divorce that happened 20+ years ago.  

anyways, i tried to commit suicide a few years ago and this incident is sparking flashbacks from that and i can't seem to stop ruminating on various thoughts related to that and this situation. my mom described to me in vivid detail exactly what happened (i really wish she would have spared those details) and visuals of both the scenario and my own suicide attempt keep flashing in my mind. i'm scared and i don't know what to do. 

i was home all day right across the street from her and i had no idea what was going on which chills me to the bone and makes me feel really awful. i feel horrible for her husband who came home and found her several hours deceased still hanging with the rope around her neck. i feel terrible for her kids. they had strained relationships with her and were fighting with her the day this happened. they are probably going to carry around the guilt for the rest of their lives. her husband is more than likely going to be severely traumatized and live with ptsd and nightmares for the rest of his life. 

i feel really guilty cos my mom and i often made fun of her and ripped on her pretty hard. fuck...if only we knew. i should have known though, i myself suffer from quite severe mental illness. i guess the lesson to be learned here is to be less of an asshole cos you never know what people are going through behind closed doors.

i want to move out of this neighbourhood now knowing the horrors that have happened right across the street plus the horrors from my own childhood that happened in this house. i don't think i'm ever going to be able to sleep soundly here again.

i don't want to personally involve myself - i want to report it to the police or something of that sort. the community that she's apart of doesn't really have a ""suicide"" type of rule so i'm afraid they'll end up deleting it without even taking notes of the behavior.

so i was abused since i was a kid.  been institutionalized i think 3 times for suicide attempts.  diagnosed with depressive disorder around 14, around the same time i entered foster care.  i never got treatment (antidepressants) until recently, and i took the whole bottle of them (one a day as prescribed, not all at once, obviously) but i ran out and haven't gotten more because i'm bad at scheduling doctors appointments because of my anxiety.  the clerk always feels patronizing to me, i feel as if they think there's something wrong with me (like i'm retarded) even though they don't even know who i am and i've never been diagnosed with anything mental except depressive disorder, and don't have any serious physical disability.  so i hate calling and thus i put it off and put it off more.  i tried about 2 weeks ago to schedule an appointment but i just got a busy signal both times and i haven't tried since.

i was supposed to go in to talk with them about my vitamin d levels as well as the antidepressant in early may, so i'm about a month overdue, and that makes me not want to go back as well because i'm afraid i'll be scolded, and rightfully so because it's fucking stupid not to.  but i think the antidepressant did help me a bit.


----

my living situation:
----

so like i said i'm 19 and in foster care.  never lived anywhere for over a year since i was like 3.  i'm in a program that pays for my apartment (with one roommate), food, cable, and transportation.  i work as a dj but the work is not consistent.  working one night a week is enough because i make so much doing it, but some weeks i don't get any work.  

i was attending college, but now college is out for the summer.  the college financial aid department fucked me over by telling me i'd keep my financial aid even if i failed a class, which i did, and then they called me and said i'd lost financial aid for next semester.  that means i can't really go.

one big point of stress about this:
----

anyway, this program houses like 12 people around my age at this apartment complex, two to an apartment.  they took a lease out on more apartments than they needed, and since my roommate and i were the first to move in and thus have the first lease to expire, they've forced us to move to a different apartment in the complex.  this has been incredibly stressful because i was settled in and i have so much shit to move.  it was dropped on us suddenly, we first heard about it monday, was told we'd move sometime this week, and monday night they came into my apartment and told me to start moving.  well, i moved, and then tonight the manager of the place started bitching at me because apparently i wasn't supposed to move.  my roommate and i moved most of our things this afternoon.  we're supposed to be out by thursday though, it doesn't make any sense and we're getting mixed signals from the manager and all the staff who work here, and nobody is communicating with us.  i'm in the new apartment right now and apparently i'm not supposed to be even though nobody fucking told me until like 10pm, when i'd already moved my electronics and my bedding and more or less everything else i own except some furniture and my pa speakers.

my sleep schedule is terrible, it's virtually impossible for me to fall asleep before 5am.  tomorrow i've got to wake up, get a ppd shot, finish moving, unpack, clean, get bitched at by the manager for her own goddamn lack of communication skills, and then relax.  not really that bad a day, i've had far far worse days in my life, but the soft life of foster care has made me very soft compared to how i used to be when i was abused, even though by most people's standards i'm still ""hard"", like stoic and confident and tough and whatnot, and i'm absolutely dreading tomorrow.  

additionally, i'm terrified that they're going to make me get a minimum-wage job.  there's something (possibly lyme or it may be due to my extreme vitamin d deficiency) wrong with my bones, i can't handle the physical stress and every time in the past i've had a job like that it pushed me closer to suicide every fucking day.  djing is all that i can handle because it's less prolonged stress and it's only one night a week at most, plus i find it extremely enjoyable, it's more or less the only thing that makes me happy.  i'm also looking to be a substitute teacher for a local highschool next semester because i meet the state's requirements to be one.  i could handle a desk job and that's the only one i can really think of that i may be able to get.

i'm not the type to just roll over and be defeated and all, which is why i'm a dj.  i'm a go-getter.  and i'm sure i could come up with another way to make money.  i just haven't yet, partially because my motivation has completely died.  i used to get up early, hop on my bike, pin up fliers advertising myself around town, go into random businesses and ask if they had any use for a dj, all that, but now i forget to repost my ad on craigslist half the fucking time, much less actually go out and market myself physically.  plus even with the inconsistent gigs i'm still grossing more money than my peers here, because i save at least 90% of everything i make, whereas they burn through their money like it's no object.  i have about $600 in the bank, despite spending about $1200 on equipment after working my way to that sum using speakers and lights i got from a goddamn thrift shop for $50, and most of them don't even have $100 despite working nearly 40 hours a week every week.


----

relationship status
----

another big problem for me is that i just can't get a girlfriend.  i'm hot, i project confidence even though as you can tell here i'm actually a wreck (i'm good at it because i always had to put up a facade while i was living with my mom), i'm not creepy or whatever.  i've had about 7 girlfriends/fwbs since highschool.  but i've been single for 6 months now.  it's killing my self-esteem because having a girlfriend is more or less all that makes up my self-worth.  i only have one or two friends.  my last girlfriend practically begged me to stay friends with her, and i tried, but for literally no reason (it was 100% out of the blue) she just suddenly started ignoring me completely.  i still have the christmas tree she loaned me in december, which i was under the impression had a lot of sentimental value to her, but she's refused to come and get it for months and now all contact has been cut.

i've tried tinder but the chicks on there don't seem to understand it's a dating app.  i get a ton of matches and have good conversations with them, but time after time as soon as i actually ask them out they just completely stop responding.  i think the bitches are just using it to boost their ego, because why the hell else would they match with me, talk/flirt with me for a few hours, drop hints about going on a date, and then just disappear the moment an actual date is mentioned?

i have extremely limited social contact in real life because i'm too young to go to bars, college is out, and those are the only two social things i know.  i'm fucking isolated and i'll never meet anyone because of it.  i need someone but because i know for an absolute fact that i'm much more attractive than the average dude, my standards are too high to go for some ugly fat chick.  so i want to fucking die because what kind of pathetic fucking worm is this attractive but can't get a girlfriend?  it's as if i'm on-par with the disgusting slime from /r/incels or whatever.  i must be absolutely fucking worthless or something.  i literally used to have girls all over me, 6/7 of my past girlfriends were hot by my standards and they came on to me just in classes and whatnot.

i think about my most recent ex pretty much every night, because i don't understand why she just suddenly decided to act like i don't exist.  obviously in these situations it's usually that the dude did/said something creepy, but i absolutely didn't, our last conversation was that i'd be a few minutes late for the presentation we had together in a class we took together the semester after we broke up.  we did the presentation (which i wound up not even being late for, and it was some bullshit about art), then for the rest of the semester whenever i'd talk to her she'd seem to be very awkward about it, and she completely stopped responding to texts.  there was absolutely nothing (on my end of things) between then, so i think it may have been her ex.  she broke up with him to get with me, they'd been together for 2 years.  he was abusive but she had/has self-esteem issues so she rolled with it.  when we broke up she assured me they wouldn't get back together, but i'm not so sure.  she and i broke up because i was having some sort of mental issue that started shortly after we got together and ended a few months after we split.  more or less the issue was that i would always be extremely tired physically and mentally, which was a problem because she was very demanding for sex, and i could never remember things she said, because i couldn't remember fucking anything for some reason.  i went from the sauve and charming confident dude she got the hots for to a blithering idiot she probably thought gave 0 fucks about the relationship, because she said she felt like i wasn't listening, just because i couldn't remember things.  i tried explaining it to her but it's just such a fluke weird thing (never happened before in my life) that i'm sure she thought it was an excuse.


----


anyway, i guess those are the main thing.  idk what to do about either of those.  but if i got a girlfriend then the problem with my living and work situation wouldn't seem so bad at all.  but i can't, because i'm too fucking young to go to literally the only social spot(s) in 40 miles and 90% of chicks are on tinder just to get an ego boost rather than to actually go out with someone.


i guess since it's late and i've got to get up early (noon probably) tomorrow i'm gonna go to sleep.  so i'll be back tomorrow to respond and read and stuff, i'm not killing myself tonight, gaurenteed.  i'm heavily considering calling my ex and begging her to come back but i guess i'll save that for another night...",suicide,suicide,1.0

i usually don't sleep at night anymore and force myself to get exhausted just to feel tired enough to sleep because i'm terrified of having another nightmare, another too good to be true dream, or another wake up to a terrible mood. i exhausted myself, slept for 2 hours, woke up feeling extremely suicidal and my mind literally kept repeating its intrusive thoughts to end it already. 

i didn't even feel right in my own body. i don't know how i was controlling myself. i woke up only because i had to leave the house with my parents to stay with someone else with ac bc the heatwave is terrible so i knew i had to prepare to leave or else i'd get yelled at. i had no motivation to get up and get ready to leave whatsoever but i did it anyways. i don't know how, i don't know who did it. all i heard were my suicidal intrusive thoughts and idk, i guess i was dissociating again because i know the feeling of watching myself go through tasks and shit

i have school so i don't have the time to be this angst lmao. i haven't even started my notes or reading for a quiz that i have due tomorrow, and its a pretty big quiz.

"i'm shocked and quite apalled. i was feeling productive so i got my dog on a leash, grabbed my phone, and went on a walk. we went down the usual path and i was expecting the usual quiet chatter around the patios, birds chirping and leaves rustling, when i spotted an african man smoking next to his car. he seemed good natured and waved at me with a smile, so i returned the greeting and passed him, a few feet away when a policeman came out of nowhere and started talking to him heatedly. i recognized the policeman who patrols around the area, so i stopped, curious, and heard much of the conversation. the policeman was talking about how cigarettes were bad and that it was polluting the air, and snatched it out of the man's hand only to crush it beneath his boot. i was confused, as he had never objected with any other person smoking in this area. the man apologized and told the officer that he wouldn't ever smoke again in this area, but the policeman shook his head and *told him he needed to pay a fine.* at this point i wish i did something. smoking is pretty common around this area and this man should not be fined for something everyone does. but i just gripped my dog's leash tighter, and i didn't do anything. 

the man apologized again and asked for a chance, saying that he had seen no warning of the ""non-smoking area"". the policeman started to threaten the man of arresting him and even tried to grab his wrists and pull hard so he was jerked forward. i'm shameful to say that at this point i just bowed my head and walked away quickly. 

i'm so disappointed at myself for not speaking out. i may have just misunderstood the situation or something but i highly doubt that. it's shocking to see, and i honestly don't know why he suddenly went up against cigarettes right when he allowed it before, but i think today was not a good day for the african american man i passed by.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

". slightly non-traditional post. i worry about my girlfriend. and i have a question.my girlfriend suffers from depression, an emotionally abusive family (who steals her disability checks), and cerebral palse (caused by her mother drinking, smoking, and partying while 4 months pregnant causing her to be 2+ months premature). she lives with me now to get away from her family. shes in college and working but it's very hard on her and she can't drive because of the cp. shes stopped now. but she has cuts all the way up her wrists and she's tried to kill herself several times. i began dating her in december. i wanted her to meet a nice guy. she used to date assholes: sexual abuse, verbal, and even sometimes physical (don't worry. i've talked to most of the guys {who are usually all scrawny punks} and had a little more than a word with the guy that practically raped her. granted usually strong words from a 240lb biker who lifts every day usually teaches you enough of a lesson). i wanted her to have someone that wanted to take care of her. show her the good side of relationships. the problem is. she always goes on about how she ""would never survive without me,"" and how she's ""helpless without me."" and as the relationship goes on and we improve her situation it seems like she becomes more dependent on me. i get her to college. i got her a job so she can make a little money. she lives with us to get out of her terrible home life. but i never intended this relationship to ""be forever""  like she wants. i love her. i really do. as a friend. i know this is harsh. but i only post it here because i actually worry about her. other than the motorcycles and the occasional street race i'm a straight laced guy. a businessman. i'm going to school for a biomedical degree. i'm gonna be a hospital guy. shes a partier. shes done her share of drugs (i stopped that habit, along with her drinking and smoking.) she hangs out with people that get in a lot of trouble (all of whom hate me for dragging her out of that group of thieves, drug dealers, and generally violent people). shes always go getting new piercings and tattoos and dying her hair. (which is fine. it's just not me.) she's abrasive and passionate. im not. if she's the kid in your class or at your work that stands out. i'm the one you didn't notice whose quietly doing his work. like i said. i dated her hoping it would get her on track. and it did. but i worry she will slip off. because the truth is. we aren't compatible. and i can't see an exit strategy that won't crush her. she's so madly ""in love"" not with me, but the way i've improved her situation. but she misplaces it on me. like i'm the boyfriend sent from on high to take her away and keep her happy the rest of her life. when the truth is i went into this relationship knowing she has flaws that don't mesh with my huge flaws well. (for example. i believe in hard work and getting things done as efficiently as possible as quickly as possible, to the point i'm a severe workaholic, i used to suffer from depression and a bad home life too. i just buried it in work not parties and drugs. while she procrstinates. it causes massive fights already.) knowing this was temporary. i knew had i not been their for her she would have killed herself. i know. because just after we started dating she tried. and i stopped her. but i don't know how to move this relationship back to just being friends. she wants so many things i can't provide. i see her as the friend i grew up with. because of that i can't feel ""intimate"" with her. she wants these things. like physical passion but i can't provide them. i can't see a future. but i don't want to drive her to make a mistake that would ruin hers. any suggestions? i really need to figure this out. just keep in mind. i do love her. i've known her since kindergarten. we've been in the same school and classes for 13 years. i just can't have a relationship with her. i want to be her friend. someone watching out for her. because if it wasnt me. no one would. not even her family. i feel like my place in her world is not her boyfriend. but almost like a parent. even though she's older than me. she never had good ones. and she needs someone to keep her safe. to talk her down. but i feel like my job is like that of a watchful friend. i'm already constantly trying to get her out of bed. and reminding her of appointments and dragging her to school. i just feel like that is not something a boyfriend should do. but a good parent. thank you for your time.",suicide,suicide,1.0

every single day i click through my classes, every single tab, to make sure that i'm not missing anything. i'm all caught up on my stuff, i check my grades, everything is fine, except i feel like i'm not doing enough work this week for geology. after she gave me my other assignment when i emailed her, the stupid exam popped up in my grades with a 0. ***my grade went from a 102 to a damn 80.*** i was pretty proud of my grade, happy that i'm not failing, trying to maintain my a's. but what the actual fuck. *how the fuck is she just gonna say ""sorry, it was there"" and give me a 0 when i know damn well it was never fucking there. at all. ever. and it still isn't there. anywhere. nowhere in sight.*

i was so sad earlier that i laid on the floor for 3 hours, and didn't go to the rest of my classes except for my last period. now i'm just frustrated that she hasn't emailed me back when i asked about trying to make it up or something.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

i can't deal with this anymore, it's becoming very overwhelming. when i look at myself i see wasted potential. i have so many irrational fears and although i know they're 100% irrational and false they've been conditioned into my brain over so many years that it becomes an automatic way of thinking. point is i cannot deal with this anymore, it's really emotionally devastating. i feel like i'm under house arrest most of the time. i'm just coming here to get this off my chest. i really feel like letting everything go.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i haven't figured out yet how to exit this world. i must think of a way that will have the least amount of impact. mainly, so my kids know as little as possible about my death. but also, because my life had little impact.

"advice neededasking for a friend who's in school:
1.people in the classroom would talk shit about her and they think that she cant hear but in fact they are ""whispering"" really loudly.

3. whenever my friend tries to talk to them they would straight up treat her existence like air.
all of this rlly affects her as she have nvr been so openly hated before and worse of all she doesnt have any friends in school (im only friends with her outside school), and everyone seems to be spectators watching the show refusing to help just bc the grp of people who bullies her are considered ""popular"" and not to be messed with.
she became rlly fearful of gng to school, told her parents and me abt the situation but there was nth we could rlly do, as she is afraid of confronting them too, bc there is a risk of further elevating the situation. now she cant concentrate on even her studies(she was a straight a student) as this constantly plagues her mind.

"hey guys, i'm pretty downi have a lot on my mind, just throwing it out there. not looking for pats on the back or encouragement.

ive never been comfortable with making friends, ever. i am now 30. i have, however, become superb with justifying why i dont need help or friends. ive had such a hard time finding a job that fits me since i moved to houston. 

i moved here to be there for my daughter. i get along somewhat with my daughter's mother, but since i dont want to marry her, she takes it hard and has a bitterness toward me. now we have a 2nd daughter, 1 and 3 years old. her and i cannot and dont live together, and her dad is nice for the most part, but gives me shit about not marrying.

im not all that dumb, but i fell apart first semester in college when i was 17, and again when i tried another semester at community college 2 or 3 years later. it seemed so inefficient, and i have always given up at the drop of a hat if it didnt come naturally easy to me. 

anyway, ive changed jobs ~every 6 months since i moved here, and it's hitting me like a ton of bricks how this pattern is keeping my value at 10$ an hour, and i dont know what the fuck to do. 

for the first time ever, in june i missed my rent payment and i'm seeing how my low value affects my kids. i am pro at hiding my feelings, even from myself. i have to do something about it. i looked into a coding bootcamp, but i dont have the credit for a loan. i trieed skillcrush and it didnt fit me; it seems like i need a tutor, but again, i dont know where to start, and i have such doubt that it will pay off. 

im back to delivering pizzas with a smile and a hustle in my step, but i know i can only keep this up for so long, unless maybe i see a light at the end of a tunnel like i meet someone to play music with regularly or a real life coding buddy. i feel like my life is just starting and im in a room with no way out and no light.

i keep getting close and thinking that i should call out for help one last time, maybe there is something missing that i havent considered. and to no one elses fault, people try to help but really nothing can help me when all thats on my mind is how disgusting and evil i am and how i want to hate and hurt myself and the reality doesnt matter. 

frankly, whats pushing me over the edge is the fact that my future is the isolation and self hatred now but worse and the fact that i am frustrayed and give up. nothing is working and i have tried a lot. every way i try to look at life, i still end up so ashamed and guilted and angry at the hunk of shite i am. 

i havr been waiting and waiting so long. i guess the day to finally do it is whenever i have grown tired of failing and hurting and being what i am. that day was long ago, i fucking give up, i will never be better. i am so fucked in the head, i make no sense, i understand and know nothing, i'm a moron with nothing to be proud of. 

if i attempt, i cannot fail because it will permanently destroy my life and relationship with family and the logistics of work and school. luckily its hard to fuck up with a shotgun. suicide is stupid because i destroy the family i love, i cant predict the future and i permanently am over. but i am so frustrated with it all, i want it to be over and don't care if its the dumbest decision ever or even if it destroys my family. 

what else can i wait for? no one can save me and i am not saving myself. i cant try, no one can fix me for me. i have tried it all, i'm just a pathetic moron making problems for myself when i should have none. i don't think there is any answer out there or solution. theres a good chance i feel better tomorrow and not do it. but eventually at this rate, i will. i need to get angry enough at myself for the courage to drive out, get drunk and do it.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i cant get this deep sunk feeling in my heart out of me. do you ever get that heart sinking feeling when you look at a family heirloom that is irreversibly damaged? well when my dad was a young teen, he bought a jacket that he loved dearly. it was a discontinued silver and red chicago bulls jacket and he gave it to my brother. he accidentally put it in the washing machine and the majority of the grey/sliver is a sort of irreversibly pink that just kills me internally when i look at it. i don't know why because its not mine, and it doesn't have any large significance or importance to me",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0
"think i’m able to do it now.wasn’t able to do it for years and years. last time i got this close was back in 2015 when i had a whole box of pills i was gonna take, and i just couldn’t do it. well last week i stayed up late getting drunk and i had a box just sitting there, put them all in a cup and i realised there was nothing stopping me this time. last time i was too scared... what if it doesn’t work? what if it gets better? what will i be missing out on? well this time, the fear is gone. only thing that stopped me was the realisation that i can go out and get more, and really cut out any chance of making it out alive. so i went to the pharmacy and used an old prescription to pick up some new pills, added them to the collection. it’s enough to kill me now for sure. this is gonna be a lame comparison, but you know that episode of family guy where brian talks about having a gun in a safe, just in case it ever gets too much?.that’s where it feels like i am, right now. i know next time things really go to shit i’m just gonna do it, and now that i know that things can actually end i feel like i’m really living and like my life really matters -living is a choice now, so continuing on feels so much more meaningful now that i know i’m not more or less forced to do it anymore. 

all the same, how long is it gonna be until my next meltdown when all it takes is a particularly shitty day to push me over the edge? and all the same again, what does it matter when i’ve got nothing to lose, anyway? what have i gained in the past four years, after i realised i was too chicken to do it back in 2015? i don’t know. what am i losing if i try to call it quits? i don’t know again. part of me really want this to end, part of me wants to keep trying. how do i pick who’s rational? can i know? i feel like it’s a leap of faith either way. i do it, and lose the chance that things could get better. or i don’t, and run the risk that things will never get better. but i feel like i’m on a time limit of all of a week before i have another bad night, and get drunk enough to really want to go for it again. i don’t know what to do. i think i’m just gonna try and wait it out and try and go on living with this new respect i have for living, and hope for the best one way or another.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"abusive relationship destroyed everythingmy boyfriend of six months just told me i needed to choose between him and my family. i knew it was an insane thing to ask, and i walked out the door. that was a few days ago, been nc since. but i'm realizing this relationship destroyed so much more than i'd realized. we are both from the same small culture and the same small community for that culture in our region. everybody knows i was with him, and he is telling people that my ""crazy family"" is to blame for him ""leaving"" me. (incidentally, my family might not have seemed ""crazy"" to him if he hadn't been openly and consistently rude to them.) his ties in our community are stronger and more authoritative than mine. i can no longer show my face around the community or in our house of worship (or in any of the ones affiliated with ours in the region, because he is connected to all of them). in addition, my career is very tightly linked to this community and is dependent on having good relations with many of our community's institutions. he has destroyed that for me, even going so far as to estrange me from some very important professional contacts, whom he happens to be close to, by making up lies about me. these contacts were really instrumental in helping me build my career. before i met him, i was developing good relationships with these people and i felt happy that i was getting an opportunity to earn their respect. and now they are against me because of him. on top of all that, the pressure that this man put on my family has caused them to pull away from me, and now they say they are ""done with me"" because i have ""become a different person"" even though i am no longer with him. he ""changed me,"" they say, and they want no part of the new person that i have become. 

after six months of him trying to separate me from my family (i stupidly thought i could get him to a point where he would be ok with them), snapping at me, saying mean things to me under the guise of ""caring about me,"" and screaming at me randomly for no reason, i am finally out of this bad relationship, but everything in my life has been shattered by it. my bright future is not what it used to be. he has destroyed my relationship with my family, my career, and my standing in our community. nothing will ever be good again. 

i have never thought about suicide before, but now i just cannot stop thinking about swallowing a bottle of tylenol pm with a bottle of vodka and just ending it. last night i even took my first baby step into ""practicing."" i've taken unisom before to help me sleep, even though i know that sometimes it makes my heart feel funny and stop breathing in the night. normally i'll take 25mg. last night i took 100. i knew it wasn't nearly enough to kill me, but i just wanted to see what would happen. i know that sounds sick. an hour went by before i had to jump out of bed and vomited it all up (not on purpose). it was very unpleasant. the only thing really stopping me from trying again is the thought that i might actually survive it and be fucked up for life. i work in a field where even a little bit of brain damage would end my career, so i can't afford to fail. sometimes i think, ""what if life gets better?"" but i don't see how it could possibly get better after this relationship--with a man i really thought was the one--has not only failed but has also left my life in shambles.

"the problem is me.i've been kinda getting more serious about my depression. i'm an asian sixteen year old male from the u.s and in my senior year of high school (i'm born really late). i have seen a counselor at my school once about my depression (a teacher brought me there when i told her about being depressed), but i had to lie to her when she asked me if i had ever made any actual plans for suicide. lately i've been feeling more alone and isolated. i used to talk to my friend about my depression and suicidal thoughts since we both had them, but i drifted from her, which i'm completely fine and happy with. i tried talking to my other friend about it and at first she did make me feel a bit better and like i actually mattered, but she's kinda bad at comforting people. i mean she tried so that's what's important, but i've tried so many times to get to know her better, but i'm failing at it. she's two grades below me and she has her own group of friends. they have their own skype group which i can't join due to one of them not being able to join the call if there are more than 8 people. i try to get in and hopefully be able to know them better i guess, but it's hard to break into a already formed cliche. they always go out and have fun, which is expected, but i feel so alone whenever they make plans in front of me and i'm not even mentioned, just there. recently i showed my friend a cool new asian all you can eat restaurant and she said she wasn't really interested. a week later she tells me they're going to eat at that restaurant and i just give a fake laugh and smile while saying an exaggerated ""wooow"" and ""fuck you guys lol"" in a light tone to disguise how sad i felt. about a month or two we went to the movies and mall with a group of friends and the whole time i felt so alone (i made the plans to go). i was mostly talking to my friend ""blank"" because he didn't know any of them. after watching the movie we were supposed to wait and hang out at gamestop until we got picked up, but i just couldn't take it anymore and just walked into the mall and hid. i got a few missed calls from my friend and an angry text from her asking why i ran off. i pretty much just told her that it would have been better if i had just not went and they would have more fun without me. this continued on for a short while with me saying that i was pretty sure they would have more fun without me. she got even more pissed at me because she thought i was playing the ""pity card"". i actually meant what i said because i don't value myself that much when i'm depressed. i was pretty sure our friendship was going to die that day because that's similar to what happened with the other girl i was close with, but it survived and we pretty much just said what we thought. tbh i fretted so much to see if i was playing the pity card, i spent an hour looking online about it and depression. i'm pretty smart and logical so i'm pretty sure i wasn't. i kind of want to die. i'm kinda making plans to kill myself by -------, i'm aware of all the risks, but i've hit the point where i see no upside anymore. i think i'd rather be dead than feel so alone even though i'm surrounded by friends. i've tested several times where i would go a week without starting a conversation with my friends and see who would actually start a conversation instead of me always starting it. the result was no one. no one messaged or tried starting a conversation with me. the movies and testing for people to start conversations all take place during summer vacation. i'm not ""depressed"" right now, but i just feel like i should be writing here right now.

"i don't want to live a life of misery.this is my 4th suicidal relapse this year, after the last time i tried thinking that things would get better. not at all, things have only gotten progressively worse for me. i tried branching out and making new friends, everyone wants nothing to do with me. a girl who i thought was nice to me really was just kidding and thought my misery was hilarious. my parents just tell me to 'get over it' and stop being depressed but i can't. i can't ignore the reality of being alone and miserable for the long existence i have ahead of me. i just guess happiness isn't intended for everyone and i'm stuck watching others be happy. every time i see someone become in a relationship on facebook or i see a couple holding hands on the sidewalk, i always recognize that as something i will never be able to have and that life is just a cruel fucking joke where everyone is happy and content with their lives except myself and others who get to watch and never know what happiness is like. bottom line is that i have found happiness is impossible for me and that i can never have it even for a second. i don't want to live a life full of misery and torment, where i can only watch as others enjoy their lives while i will be eternally sad. my 17 years has allowed me to see what life will truly be like for me in the future and it doesn't look good, i wish i could live like everyone else but that has become apparently impossible. i will always be miserable and alone and nothing except death can change that. it's a big and permanent decision but i think it will be the best for not only me but everyone else. no one will give a shit that i'm gone, people at school will probably laugh when they hear i'm dead. i can guarantee that i will not contribute a single amount of good to the world when i am older so there is no point in living.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"(26yr male) post ssri emotional numbness, pssdabout four years ago i was forced by my mom to go to the psych ward because she couldn’t handle my anxiety, which i only had for a few months becaus of university stress. they put me on zoloft and when i went home my mom manipulated me into believing it was good for me even though i did not want to be on it. thus, i stayed on it until late last year. since then i have had near zero emotional range and severe pssd (no libido, no natural erections, no feeling during orgasm). i also can’t sleep very well and when i inevitably wake up, i feel so uncomfortable i pace. i was never like this prior to the medication, in fact i had no history of anxiety or mental issues prior to the university induced anxiety. 

there is little to no information online about solutions to emotional emptiness and pssd. i barely get through the day and consider suicide often. in high school i graduated with top honours and was a very emotionally connected person, now i can barely work or function as i have no emotions (ex interest, motivation, happiness, sadness, regret, excitement, anticipation, etc). i have zero interest in living since i have near zero emotional range, plus my pssd just seals the deal.

i’ve read extensively on the long term effects of ssris on brain cells, serotonin/dopamine levels, etc. i’ve read the abstracts of studies, reports from people with similar issues, etc. ive probably put over a hundred hours into research and there’s no known true solutions to the spectrum of issues i can find that gives me any hope.

i just want to die and get it over with already. this is chemically induced emotional and sexual castration. i should’ve never been on these pills and i stupidly continued to take them despite not having any issues past that brief phase. i also developed a drinking problem thats probably given me brain damage — 5 to 10 beers a night over four years, i stopped recently but i can tell there’s damage to cognitive functions, especially memory and focus.

the medication made me into a completely different person and slowly took my emotional range and libido. it’s been almost a year being off zoloft and no improvements. i want to die.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i wish people would stop telling me that life is worth living and for once just try to understand how i feeli'm not asking them to encourage me to end it. but i wish someone, literally anyone would just empathize with me for just a minute. just say that they get it. say that they understand why it's so hard to keep on living. i know that it's wrong to want to die and i know that i need help and i know that my life has a purpose but those are empty statements made by people that don't seem like they actually care about seeing it from my angle.

i've chosen a method. i added the supplies i need to my cart on amazon and then chickened out and didn't place the order. i don't know if i really have any intention of actually using it, but i just want the comfort of knowing that it's there if i need a way out. 

i don't need people to tell me that i'm doing the right thing by getting supplies to go through with it but i also just wish someone would tell me that they get it and that even if they want me to feel better they know that it's not that easy. i wish someone would understand how tired i feel constantly because just waking up and having to face the thought of going through another day is enough to wear me out.

not sure what i want out of posting this. i just feel so alone and i'm scared of myself. i'm scared of ordering those things. i don't want to and at the same time i want to more than anything because i just want everything to stop. i want it all to be over. i just don't know what to do anymore.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"life is miserablei’m a 34 year old male that still lives with his mother. i’ve been working a dead end job for 15 years and i haven’t enjoyed a single day of it since it began. 

i collect shopping carts at a supermarket and it’s shameful, the weather is terrible to work in, i have no friends at work, no love for the work and i spend half the day hiding. i have no other skills, interests, or qualifications. i can’t drive a car, i have no motivation, a minuscule attention span and i am stupid. i am utterly incompetent.

there are too many more problems in my life to even mention that make everyday so bleak. i have no support from family or friends. i reached out for help to the doctors countless times but nothing changed. i’ve heard all the advice you could give a 1000 times before. i either don’t follow it or i’m incapable of following it. my life is pretty much the same as it was when i was 18, just worse.

i am so tired and back thinking about suicide a lot. i had a girlfriend who was wonderful but i lied about my life for 2 years just so i could date her because i’m thoroughly ashamed of the loser i am in reality. she lives in a different country and i have no way of living a good life with her. she deserves a lot better.

"someone died at my school. what's new? like literally. i'm now a senior in high school, and every single year (literally every year) someone has died. most of the time it's suicide. one time a girl literally overdosed in the hallway. one time it was a freak, sport accident. 

i make my school sounds really bad. i go to a really, really good public school. amazing teachers. teachers come from other states to teach here. but, there is definitely a mental health problem, which is fatal in some cases.

so far no cause was given. but it's always the same. ""we are deeply saddened to inform you that [name] has died."" usually it'd be announced during school, and we'd give a moment of silence, but that's impossible due to hybrid learning.

the teachers and counselors try their best. we have hired greif counselors. the school tries their best to help with mental health. in health class we go over coping strategies and ways to maintain good mental health.

but it just feels like too much (and nothing at all at the same time). it's never been someone in my year/class that's died; it's always someone that i don't know. so i feel sad and bad, but at the same time i'm not overcome with greif; i literally didn't know anyone that had died.

but when literally every single year someone dies (i think it was last year or the year before that there were two people that died), it just gets ""stupid."" 

and it feels so fake. like there's a ""moment of silence"" and a ""we regret to inform you"" email, but i still have a history presentation on tuesday. i still have a spanish test on monday. life goes on.

but personally i just feel overwhelmed. there's a literal pandemic going on. like just think for a second; we're in a literal pandemic wtf. you read about pandemics in history books, but actually experiencing them is something else. i have too much school work. i have too many extracurriculars. i have college apps.

i'm just overwhelmed and feeling the burden of knowing that someone died in my school just is a little too much right now.

"i've come to the end of the road.23m. i'm tired. i'm so tired of all of this. i can't keep going when everyday just hurts me more. everyday, i go to sleep and there's just one thing less to wake up to, and everyday, i just seem to be more exhausted than the day before. these last few months, i've just been grinding down to what i know will be my last day. 

i've always been a social outsider. i've tried so hard to make friends, but i always seem overbearing to people who just never seem interested in being friends with me. people don't like me and they think i'm a complete prick. everyday, there's just one more embarrassing that i've done to make a complete fool out of myself. i've only ever had one girlfriend, and she wound up cheating on me. it's been nearly a year since i last had sex.

yesterday, i discovered that my boss and his fuckbuddy have been guessing what variation of autism i have. for months now, i've suspected that i have some sort of autism and i feel disgusting. people look at me like there's something wrong with me and now i know why. people see me as some charity case, and they look down at me. i know i'm weird and creepy and nobody likes me but it's got to be too much now. nobody is interested in anything i have to say anymore, and i'm tired of rattling off whatever new fascinating thing i've learned about today only to discover nobody except me actually gives a single shit.

i feel completely trapped. i have no money and i am thousands of pounds in debt. i am addicted to painkillers. nothing makes me happy except the brief fleeting joy i get from films and tv and my dog. i love her. but i can't leave, and i think i've seen too much of this wonderful world to be satisfied with this place. 

the only reason i haven't killed myself yet is because i am too much of a coward. years of self harm have scared me out of anything so drastic. so now i'm trapped in this endless misery with no exit. i try to fill my time with writing this book i'm trying to get going, but that's not enough. it's not real. it doesn't need me.

ultimately i think that's what i want. to be needed. but nobody needs me and nobody wants me. so i just wanted to put this here, just to show that i tried to reach out, or something. i don't know. i feel like a shitty person just posting this but i feel completely trapped. i'm sorry.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"depressive and suicidal liar looking for advice i guesshello everybody,
i am making this post because i have no idea what i should do.
my situation is that i am depressed and suicidal and next to that also an almost perfect liar. 
when i was young i was bullied because i am fat and had no single friend till i was around 13/14 years old. at that moment is was in school and got into gaming. school was easy for me and never had to learn a single thing to get a good grade. i got lazy this way. when i finished middle school i had to choose a direction of work i wanted to study for. i made a poor choice and already quit the study after a month. at this period i also got problems with my body because i was and am way to heavy. i had some surgeries and everything looked fine from the outside. however, i was feeling down all the time, i never talked with my friends anymore because they were studying and doing other stuff then gaming. i got isolated. the next year of school i started with a other study and fell in love with it. however, there were some problems. first, i am not a technical genius. to be fair, i suck at it and this study has quite some technical shit in there. so naturally, the lazy me, thought it would all be fine and didn’t study at all as always. however i failed al the theoretical parts about physics, chemistry and biology. next to that, the isolated me, wasn’t able to make friends because i was completely withdrawn. i didn’t want to trouble my parents with this problem and started lying about how everything was going. i also moved out of my parents place for this study by the way. this way they couldn’t see what was going on, and when i was home i lied about everything. after a few months into the study i made one friend and we hit it off. but the stupid me also lied to him about almost everything. he is a great guy but i feel bad about lying to him and to my parents. i still always feel down and nowadays also started thinking about suicide a lot. i am afraid to confront my family and my friend about my lies. this is because almost everything is a lie. i won’t be the guy who they think i am and this scares the shit out of me. next to that i am now in my second year and now i am forced of the study because i failed the tests about physics etc. so now i feel like a total dipshit, that is completely useless, a huge liar and that the persons around me would be better off without me.
i started talking to shrink but even to him i lie about a lot of stuff and it doesn’t help me at all because of it. 
i just wanted someone to hear my whole story, and maybe even give me advise. i don’t see a bright future for myself, and thus with other reasons ass well think i am going to commit suicide someday. i haven’t done it because i don’t want my family and only friend i have to go through the emotional pain.

"broken loseri am 34 and have worked a dead end job since i was 18. i’m broke, live with my mother, have no skills, no ambition, short attention span, can’t drive and i’m constantly fatigued. i feel like it’s possible that this constant depression has just grounded me down to the point where i have no energy. maybe my body is in agreement with my mind now that i should just stop moving for good.

i’ve also been dating someone for 2 years in a ldr. we’ve been together on holiday several times and it was amazing. i have been lying to her the whole time though about my living situation, job and that i can drive.

she is trying to organise a visa to come to me, but the truth is this can’t happen. i’ve been trying to put it off as long as i can. through my selfishness i have put her in a position where it would crush her.

"isn't a suicide less tragic than a poorly lived life?edit: original post removed. it was written in anger. i'm glad i managed to breach the subject and get some helpful comments however.

a relevant quote from alan moore: ""there are a frightening number of people who seem to have the urge not just to ignore the self, but actually seem to have the urge to obliterate themselves. this is horrific, but you can almost understand the desire to simply wipe out that awareness because it's too much of a responsibility to actually possess such a thing as a soul, such a precious thing. what if you break it, what if you lose it. might it not be best to anaesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure. i think that the way people immerse themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in television, in any of the addictions that our culture throws up can be seen as a deliberate attempt to destroy any connection between themselves and the responsibility of accepting and owning a higher self and then having to maintain it.""",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i do not have the reasons to live anymore :(i have had the suicidal thoughts for my whole life - it was a normal reaction to any bigger problem i had. ""why should i try to resolve when i could just end my life and the problem will resolve itself"" - i am pretty sure that you guys know such way of thinking very well.

i fough these thoughts very hard, i haven't had them since the last year (for about 7-8 months) but now they are back. i do no even know why to be honest. but i just feel that i do not have any reasons to live any more - i'm stuck at a dead-end job, i work three shifts and don't even have time to meet my friends :/ i am 25 years old, male, never had a girlfriend and i do not think it will change - all my friends are getting married or are at least in the relationships. 

the only reason i did not commit a suicide was my parents - i knew that they could not handle the pain. 

i'm pretty sure that i will not do it in the forseable future, but the pain is large, and i know that you know how it is to live with these suicidal-thoughts :(

"time is almost upso... i'm planning to finish it all in about a month. before i go, i wanted to leave my story somewhere. hopefully, someone here might be able to help me out although i don't really expect so much.

i am 23m now, and was born in s.korea from average family. my family including my parents and two brothers is mostly quiet but i know we do care for each other. from very young age, i was interested in science, and aimed to become a scientist. there are high schools specifically aimed to raise talented scientific students in my county and obviously, my goal was to get in there. it was extremely competitive thing and i studied hard. fortunately, i was good at learning and always got in top 10 in my school. however, things happened and my family had to move to china for few years. in china, i went to harrow beijing, british international school, from y9-y11. at first, i had hard time fitting in since my english was not good back then, but once i got used to it, i enjoyed many aspects of it. harrow is where i learned my country's education framework sucks and to stop by from studying from time to time and enjoy the life. i would say harrow enlightened me whether for good or bad.

after 3 years of freshing experience at harrow, life thing happened again and my family had to get back to skorea. obviously, i was too late to enter science specialized high school and went to just an ordinary high school in my country. some people might already know, but the education in s.korea is extremely harsh. students were obligated to remain in school untill late at night. i'm talking about 9am - 11pm. it was insane. i again had trouble adapting to this new system but this time it was more complicated. studying all day at the school was obviously painful both mentally and physically but it was more than that. harrow taught me critical thinking and things about life and that made me question if all this hard work is really worth it. i think at this point, i was really depressed continuously pondering about the life and death. still, i could hold on to something. i was really into cosmology at that time, and just thinking about it made me excited. i still had a reason to stay alive. after 1.5yrs, i graduated and finally entered college.

my college was one of the best in my country and it was especially speciallized in science and technology. so i could say i was successful, or at least i achieved my first goal. the college life was refreshing again. i had lots of free time doing whatever i want, lived far from home in dormitary with roommates i came to become close to and joined clubs with shared interest people. i, still, was worried about the studies since it was bascially bunch of elitists from all around my country. to my surprise, i had absoultely no problem understanding lectures and got fairly good grades from all subjects. my first year in the college passed like that untroubled.

from the year after, however, i would say i was not living a healthy life. i had much less chances to meet my friends as we got separate majors (in my college, first graders all share most of the lectures and we choose our major from the next year). they also all had their roommates reserved for their best friends, so i had to live with random roommates. for some reasons, i had trouble making friends from new people i met in new lectures. the same went for my new roommates. we barely talked to each other and lived their own lives. i guess this is the point when i started to feel truly alone and hang on to my old friends. depression did not really help with my studies also. i felt less motivated and for the first time in my life started to have some difficulties understanding things in lecture. still, it wasn't worst. i got fair grades somehow. not so good, but not so bad. just average results. however, i still had hopes of studying cosmology and that made me keep going somehow.

as some of you might have guessed, it didn't get better the next year. i still couldn't make new friends and my friends decided to focus on studying, and we barely hung out together. my roommate spent most of the time outside, even spending night somewhere else. i got more depressed each day and spent most of my time playing games in my room alone. my motivation almost ran out and i started to miss out lectures. still at this point, i had some hope left. i continued on. but it was the sixth semester. it was the climax. i had absolutely no contact with my friends for three whole months. instead i tried to motivate myself in studying and got fairly good grades at mid exam. i would say, i was lonely and depressed but hopeful. then, for unknown reason it exploded. i lost my emotions. to be more precise, i was crying in the bed everyday before, but at some point, i felt no more loneliness, depression and hope. i suddenly lost all my urges to do anythings. i didn't want to study, didn't want to go out and didn't even want to play. everything was void. i missed most of the classes, never finished homwork and finally failed my finals. and i didn't care. i would just stay in my room stare at empty space for an hour or so. every time i do anything, it was so much stress. i just wanted to vanish.

since then, i'm having break from school for over 2 years now. i feel a bit calm at home fortunately, but i still have no motivation to live. i just let time pass by. for these 2 years, i always wanted to disappear from this world, and half a year ago, i finally began to consider suicide seriously. now, i am suicidal. i plan to die at some point in march this year despite the fear of pain and consequences of death. and before you ask, i've been to therapists and department of mental health medicine for treatments. you know what. the pills i'm still taking do not seem to have any affect. therapists admitted that they can't seem to help me and introduced new therapists. current therapist also have difficulties determining my state. i also tried some on my own. i tried to do some exercise, but the physical tiredness just makes me so stressful. same goes for hobbies. i tried to draw or something but they gave so much stress that my head starts to hurt. for past few months, i worked on my last resort. i tried to get what i really wanted to before if that might help, but financial issues made them to go all in vain. now, i can't think of anything i can try. clock's ticking towards my dday and now i'm preaparing to let everything go.

so... that's my whole story. unlike may other in this thread, my life was not so troubled. i had no childhood abuse, trauma of something or lost something/someone important. it was just loneliness but i endured it for years, i don't think that was the real reason behind it. i can't even... know what caused this, what is wrong and how i would want to be. i just feel like... i don't fit into this world really that it was eventually to happen at some point. i don't know now. i am just too tired, i want to finish it all. and thinking that i'm gonna die soon makes me both worried and relieved. sorry and thanks for reading my long post. it is somewhat my last attempt before i let everything go, so i'm open for talk although i doubt it would make any differences. well, i failed but i hope anyone here who needs help gets better. farewell.",suicide,suicide,1.0

fast forward to now, i've grown to hate couples i see in the hallways. i can't stand the girls with makeup and ridiculous false lashes (i like the look of false lashes even though i've never tried them, but let me tell you, the ones these girls wear are too much.) i don't like them because they get all the boys without trying. i know it's 50% makeup but i want to be them. i just want to be loved. it's not like i don't take care of myself, i try to dress nice and i shower everyday and put some perfume on before going to school. i workout and try to eat healthy, because maybe guys don't like me cause of my weight. (5'2"" 160lbs)

it feels like i'm cursed because no one and i mean no one has ever been interested in me. at least no one who i'm interested in has been interested in me, the feelings are never mutual. i can only think of 2 boys that have liked me. one who was 3 years younger than me and liked me when i was 8, and my classmate who liked me when i was 12. i'll call him j. j was one of those ""weird"" kids.. he kept putting stuff in his mouth back then and he always looked at me like he was mad at me. it was kind of starling looking up at my work back then and just seeing him like that.

anyways, i digress. i don't know if i'll ever be loved. i just want a hand to hold and someone to cuddle with and sneak a quick kiss before heading to class. why is it too much to ask? there's girls my age who aren't that skinny either or model-pretty, how come they have boyfriends? why is love so confusing? i can't help but feel that it's turning me into a monster of some sort. i just feel really bad. sometimes i want to punish myself because i feel like it's my fault that i can't seem to deserve it.",suicide,non-suicide,1.0

a little background i guess: i have always been that quiet kid in school with 0 friends. this was after a while getting me depressed and my grades stared falling and i soon had serveral f:s which made me even more depressed. i always tried to start a conversation or something with my classmates but for the most they just ignored me and walked away. i changed school 3 times but the same thing keept happening over and over again. i now turned to desperete things and joined a small nazi party and began decorating my room with swaztikas. i always knew this was nothing for me but i kinda feelt for the first time that i was accepted and had friends. but one day i left the party and i now i had 0 persons to talk to, i was even afraid to look up and contact a therapist. it was here that i tried to commit suicide with the pills. after the suicide attempt i lost everything. i lost the little ammount of friends i had, i lost a lot money and i lost my family. 

it has now been 6 months since the suicide attempt and i am 20 years old. the swastikas has been replaced by flags of my country but my biggest interest is still ww2, mostly tanks and other neat stuff. my life has it's ups and downs but mostly downs. i still don't have any friends and my facebook hasen't been updated for months. i'm thinking of buying a gun or making some sort of bomb since i failed with the pills.

the last time i was really happy was about two years ago, and all this depression started when my girlfriend left me. admittedly, i wasn't great beforehand but she was the only thing holding me together. 

then i endured the final year of high school, it damn near killed me. i was depressed, i struggled with anxiety which prevented me from sleeping well, which made me unable to focus at school. my grades went to shit, despite be being a smart kid.  

i ended up having to settle for a different university course because my final score was so abysmal. i hate the course i'm doing, but the hope is that maybe it'll lead to a job i like. 

but in the mean time i'm working as a cashier at a grocery store. and i fucking hate it. i have autism and social anxiety disorder, so dealing with people gets me very panicked and my whole job is centred around customer service. i've tried finding other jobs but to no avail. i can't quit because i need income.   
i've been working for 3 years and i was told my anxiety would get better but it's gotten much worse. my last shift resulted in my having a full anxiety attack, i routinely suffer migraines, chest pains, dizziness and nausea and quite frankly, i don't think that's healthy .

i've tried medication but none of it works, the only drug that works is the sleeping pill, and while i can sleep better, my anxiety and depression are still running rampant.  

i'm working a job that i'm nearly in tears just thinking about, i'm studying a course i don't enjoy because of my past fuck ups that still haunt me, i don't drive because it terrifies me to my core and that makes going places difficult.

"i've been struggling a lot latelyi've been struggling like really bad. i feel like i'm losing everyone around me. i feel like nobody cares no matter how much i scream and cry for help.

a lot of things went down between me and another girl at my dance studio. she's out to get me because i got a special role in one of our dances and i'm in a dance that she's not. 

all she does is tell lies about me. i've never even done anything to her. i've only ever been nice and i thought she was my friend but i guess not. she's one of the reasons why i want to commit suicide. 

once she told our dance group that i'd been sleeping with a bunch of boys from my school. but yet i'm still a virgin. thankfully nobody believed her as far as i know but it still hurts. 

 she causes so much stress and anxiety in my life. she yells at me when i do something wrong but as doing as i call her out for doing something wrong she's the victim all of a sudden. i just want her to be gone already or i wanna be gone. which everyone comes first. maybe she realizes when i'm gone that it's blood on her hands.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"just knowing i could end it is enough most days, but not todaylet me overshare online because i can’t afford therapy anymore  

no one read this because it’s going to come off as super... annoying, probably 

i’ve been trapped in a cycle of abuse since i was really little, multiple people, all men, and now i’m 23 and i literally can’t find self worth without some form of male validation. it’s really pathetic and gross and the tip of the iceberg of reasons i hate myself. 

i just got out of a six year relationship, too, upheaved my entire life. my mdd is part of the reason it ended, i have horrible anxiety too and my ex just couldn’t cope nicely. it’s fine. i sincerely wouldn’t want to cope with someone like me either. went from having my own apartment in atlanta to being too depressed to work, brushing my teeth is a fucking chore, and i live with my fucking parents who have never dealt with mental illness a day in their lives and don’t understand why i can’t go to the bank or the grocery store or make a doctor’s appointment or eat. i don’t know why either. there’s a fucking wall there when i close my eyes, i cannot fucking do anything guys, the only word that comes to mind is impotence. maybe “loser.” i’m seriously pathetic in every conceivable way, anyone that knows the ~new me~ gets sick of me after two weeks even though i’m super self conscious about not presenting as depressed, and i am literally just a financial drain on the two people that still care about me at this point. 

self harm hasn’t cut it in a while. ah look, cute joke there. 

i just like knowing i can end it if i want to. most days i really want to. i wish there wasn’t such a stigma against it, i wish i could do it and no one would blink, i have nothing to offer the world anymore and i don’t even want to offer anything. just want to disappear. cease to exist. be fucking done.

"i'm reaching the end of my limit with these migrainesfor the last two months i have been getting migraines, they tend to hit the females on my mom's side of the family between 20 to 30 years of age. i was so close to not getting them but at age 28, they finally decided to come for me. some of them family is lucky enough to get through the age without any but most females get it. two of my cousins didn't get them so i was hoping that i would be the same, but it wasn't to be. 

i'm lucky if i can get a few days between the migraines hitting. i had one time where they left for 9 days and thought they were getting better but then they starting coming on again everyday for a week. they exhaust me, the pain causes me to feel so tired after that i end up sleeping the day away. my mom says that as i age they will get less often and less painful, but i'm not sure i can keep waiting. 

in the last two days i had three migraines, the most often they had ever happen. i had to take a sleeping aid to sleep off the last one since it was so bad that the over-the-counter pain medicine i have been taking wasn't help it. all i could think while taking the sleeping aid is that if it didn't put me to sleep, i just wanted to die instead of feeling that pain. i want to tell someone, a friend, a family member, my husband, anyone but i'm worried they will freak out since years ago i was suicidal and i don't want them to be like that again.

my mom was the last one in her family to get the migraines and she first got them about 30 years ago so i'm hoping that when i go to the doctor, they will have more answers for me than they had for her. the problem is that my husband is the only one with a job and due to issues with student loans his wages are being garnished, he is in the middle of the waiting period for them to review that we can't afford them to garnish his wages, but until then we are barely scraping by so there isn't money for me to go to the doctor. 

at the latest the review for the wage garnishment will be done in december, but i don't know if i can handle these migraines for another month. heck, i don't know if i can handle them for another week if they keep up like this, i feel like i'm in hell. i feel like my whole life right now is pain, sleeping, and eating. i know the migraines will get better after a few years but i'm not sure i can handle waiting until then.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i went to therapy hoping it would help. my therapist didn't think we could focus on the addiction because i was too depressed and suicidal. after months now of paying $40/week that we don't have my therapist and i agreed i'm not getting anything out of it.

i have degrees in psychology which means i just know too much. i'm trying not to run my own therapy, but my therapist keeps catching me doing it subconsciously. 

i have a job that i've had for a year and i love in a lot of ways, but i've managed to find myself out of my element and stressed because i'm alright at it but not great. i learned fast to minimal proficiency, but now i can't get past that point. people hired three months ago are out performing me.

so my friends told my crush (f15) that i (m15) i was into her, we have been friends for along time and i was hoping that she would just pass it off. fast forward 2 days and i walk into my biology class and to my surprise when i sat down in class she chose the seat next to me. (we are in a hybrid schedule and we both share a environmental bio class) the teacher told us to partner up with our table partner so me and her grouped up to work on or learning module. were both pretty shy so for the first 10 min or so we didn't say much, then i decided to break the silence and ask her how her day was and we went back and forth from there. we started to talk about how are sperate live are going and while she was talking i tried not to look at her chest (she was wearing a somewhat reavling shirt) and over a period of time i started to get off... then when i started to share, i mentioned how my uncle was arrested for something he didn't do and she tried to put her hand on my thigh as a comforting manner but i ended up turning to my side so i could face her and her hand landed on my crotch area. immediately it fell silent and both of our faces were flushed red, neither of us moved for what felt like an hr (and yes that includes her hand...) after a while of use akwardly sitting there i started to feel her thumb move back and forth on my thing and the whole time i just sorta stared at my chromebook screen. and of course me being a guy and the girl who i have been falling for the last 2 years puts her hand on it, it got noticbly harder. so for the rest of the period she kept her hand there while i continued to work on our module.

"the issue with ""blue pill"" ideology and the creation of incels disclaimer: i am not talking about those who actually work on themselves and strive to be the best they can by themselves. i am talking to those who procrastinate or simply lie about their own self improvement. success is earned, not given. same case with happiness. you do not get success by existing. unless you are rich then in that case i don't kmow. 

the term of the blue pill has been highjacked by antifeminists, antisjw's and other radicals. but i would rather discuss blue pill ideology in its essence and why it's so harmful. what is meant by blue pill? it's an ideology in which one has a slowly deteriorating joy and satisfaction in life caused by ignorance. typically bp ideology peaks around high school and middle schools years. people carrying such an ideology seem to almost echo the beliefs of their parents, the media they consume, and what they are told by other people perpetuating ignorance. 

as opposed to those pushing for true self improvement, self confidence and self love. blue pill is regressive and conservative in nature. in life they are promised unconditional love, friends and joy by simply existing. they do not know they have to be likable to be liked. they do not understand that respect is earned.  they believe they will magically have it given to them. the world is good on its own the blue pilled believes. eventually the blue pilled will see others jump ahead of them. they will cling to every last string holding them up to grasp to their beliefs. ""they will peak in high school"" ""i'll thrive in college"" ""i'm only focusing on myself"". unlike people who actually choose to focus on themselves, they do not. they do not wish to actually change when college comes, they only wish that the world will change for them or that they will magically change. 

in some cases those ""others"" do peak in high school but in many cases they dont. the life and accomplishments of the blue pilled only remain stagnant or worsen over time. they become neets, they do not seek employment, they do not seek higher education and they do not seek to improve. they become angry that their life hasn't improved, they anger that they aren't given what they feel they are entitled to and feel as if they are failed by society. those people become the incels you see today. that is why the attitude of incels seem so entitled. we have a society that not only dishes out ignorance, but dishes out extreme danger for those who don't catch onto it early in life. 


there's a generation that feel no hope for love and no hope for life. they think it's too late to get better. but there is no limit. if you are a virgin at 30, that's okay. if you aren't in a relationship that's okay. and if you feel you are having a quarter life crisis that's also okay. you just need to work on yourself, learn to love yourself and try your best to improve in your own eyes. and soon things may get better. therapy is also highly recommended if possible. it can do wonders. stay safe everyone, and may life be loving to you all.

"losing my mindfirst time ever doing this. i'll try to keep this terse. don't know what i expect from this. i think i just need to vent now. maybe knowing others had a similar experience will make me feel better. 

i'm 26, and i have a great stable job where i make good money as a developer, but i have stopped caring about life. the only way i get through my days is through using ampetamines redbull and a quad shot of expresso. i'm probably bipolar and definitely diagnosed with depression/anxiety. i have tons of friends (no family, dad is in the us but we don't speak anymore) who care and coworkers who adore me, i make 6 figures, and i drive a fairly new car live in a large house (with roommates granted) and i should be happy, and i don't say this to be ungrateful. i know how lucky i am to be alive, and succesful in my career at an young age. especially with so many people that are struggling. i don't mean offense. 

but basically i've lost the ability to be happy. constant moodswings. there are moments in the day where i'm laughing and smiling. it feels like happiness. weeks go by and everything is fine. but it's not because in the span of one comment or a thought it can fade into anger, resentment, depression. i know i have issues. but i'm not sure i care enough anymore to try fixing them. i'm so jaded i don't care if i wake up tomorrow. it would be better if i didn't cause i don't feel like i could kill myself. 

anyways, this is my entire life up to this point. i'll try to keep it short. there is a lot i can't say, that i want to. but i'm not ready yet so bear with me but i still want to share my story with you because i am losing my mind. 

&amp;#x200b;

childhood. 

lower middle class, and i come from a korean family. 

i was diagnosed with depression/anxiety in college, had a decent childhood despite an abusive father, neglectful mother, and reckless brother. i didn't know until my dad was abusive until college actually. i always figured he took the tough love approach. what i didn't know is that when i was younger, they (brother, mom) used to lock me in a room so i wouldn't see them get beat when my dad came home in 'those' moods. 

before they got divorced, they would fight and throw things in the house, my mother in dramatic fashion would threaten to kill herself (this is not uncommon in korean households sadly). actually now that i think about it both her and her mother would have these violent moodswings. anyways, my brother is half related through my mom. him and my father never got along. he was into gangs in in cali, so we moved and he would skip school constantly. my dad beat him excessively, he ran away and sold drugs then came back after my mom literally went insane. my brother was my rock for a long time. i looked up to him. i know he was not a bad person. i mean he would buy me toys when my parents would fight, even steal them if he had to. he literally got me every transformer from beast wars (you remember the cheetah?) and every gundam he could find. he built every gundam for me cause i was scared to break them. he's twice the man i am. we don't speak anymore but i hope he knows that. 

anyways there was one time (not sure how old i was, but i was sleeping with my dad in the spare room while mom was in the master so i must have been young) where i remember waking up and hearing her cry. small three bedroom apartment. so i got up and saw her crying and there were pills everywhere. she was slurring and then she slumped. i woke up my dad and i remember him being pissed calling the cops then going back to sleep. they had been fighting a lot. i can't remember much that happened back then. actually my memory is now is completely fucked. i can remember very few things that were not school related during this time. i remember some moments in elementary school, friends i met but i honestly cannot tell you what life was like in cali where i was born. or what it was like when i was young. i don't remember anything really it kind of scares me. i actually spent my whole life feeling priveleged until i was told exactly how bad things got. it was like confirming a bad dream that you hoped didn't happen. but you realize that it did. 

so at this point, they get a divorce. but not before (hopefully timeline is correct) my mom and brother decided to break into our family dollar store and take some money to set aside just in case. cops came, called my dad he said it was fine and i never heard about it again. actually even before this, my mom had gotten arrested for stealing from marsh. i was there when it happened and i had to see her cry and scream while they took us upstairs and showed us the footage. can't believe i forgot about that till now. but it's important to know for later. 

then i remember the divorce. the courts found a house (worth a lot, at the time we had holes in our shoes. uncles would give us money.) that he had purposefully lied to my mother about owning (he gave her a fake contract to sign, basically giving her ownership of the house). actually my dad had more than enough to support us but he was stingy or careful. i don't really know anymore. this would have been late 90s i have so many gaps in my memory i question my own sanity. long story short, bad break up, she got half (we had two dollar stores by that time) of what he had minus the house and when the courts asked who i wanted to live with i naturally said my mom. so she got 1 store, some money, and 500$ a month for child support from my dad until i was 18. 

fast forward a few years, she squandered what was left from the divorce (had no idea how to run a business), leased expensive cars and got a house we could not afford. we got evicted then moved into an apartment. by this time my brother got deployed to iraq, then afghanistan a few years later. no matter how i feel towards him, i can't say i blame he acts the way he does. i'll explain later why it's important. 

anyways, to continue. after we got a small apartment/condo she tried to start a new business selling hair pieces/wigs (idk why the fuck she did so). i found out later she had borrowed money from a lot of people during this time which explains my earlier comment about having a decent childhood. i never went hungry. i was praised as the youngest kid in my family, and i was very good at reading/math at an early age. i was the the one that would finally graduate college, which noone in my family had achieved. so back to the store, she ended up losing that as well. by this time she was dating a lot of guys maybe to find some financial security? she was much younger than my dad when they got married so maybe she was just tired. idk. this was around hs. i started noticing debts collection letters, and i told her that i would go live with dad to help make things easier. to be honest i was just pissed cause she would leave for weeks at a time to be with her bf (chinese dude, piece of shit). again this is in hs. i had no idea of being locked in a room and my father being abusive. i thought he was a hardass and my mom was just irresponsible or crazy. i left after my freshman year to live with my dad and go to a better school. she called me my sophomore year to tell me she was in korea and could never come back. that she was sorry and to not believe what people said about her. i guess people weren't happy that she left and paid nobody back. i didn't speak to her until college after that call. 

when i lived with my dad in hs, he would berate me and make me feel like i could never get anywhere because i was 'lazy'. because i didn't work 9 hours a day like he did. ironically when i asked to get a job he said my only job was to do well in school. he would tell me things like 'youll never get anywhere like your mother' or 'you'll never go to college if you don't study'. and during this time i would smoke a lot of bud to maintain my sanity. i remember having cuts all over my arms from trying to hurt myself, i got suspended for 10 day from school for smoking before on a half day. i got kicked from nhs and basically shamed by the ap teachers that saw me as a good student. i was humiliated in my church when my pastor told everyone that i was doing drugs and needed prayers (i sang songs for the youth group and whatnot). for weeks my dad wouldn't speak to me. leaving my mom was the biggest mistake of my life up to this point. 

you know what's fucked up though? i had 2250 on sat, 33 on act, pres. acad decathlon, over 15 ap credits. almost a perfect score on the chemistry subject test, state finalist for deca, nhs, i aced the math section on the sat. i spent every hour of my day studying. i went through stolen previous sat tests that my pastor had ""acquired through god"" literally would say stupid shit like that. i was still treated like shit. my dad still used to say i was lazy, or dumb cause i wanted to hang out with my friends and do normal things that teenagers do. when i lived with him i was allowed to go to two places: the church or the library. i was allowed to watch 1 movie a month with only 1 person he thought he knew, i mean why the fuck did i get constantly shit on even though i did everythign i could?

fast forward to college. i get freedom. start doing drugs constantly but somehow keep my gpa high cause i studied hard in hs. eventually got to a point where i had a mental breakdown. lost my fullride scholarship. dropped a semester. started selling bud to support myself. tried to kill myself a few times. failed miserably. thank god i had made a lot of lifelong friends that i had helped them financially when i was flush. i was good at what i did. during my time off from school i learned about my past when my mom somehow got my number and called me. we have stayed in touch since then. she told me she was sorry and then told me what happened. i fell down and sobbed for hours. a few months later i had alienated every friend i had. especially those that worked with me. i eventually spent the next year lost, then somehow crawled my way back through school and finished two years later with a math degree. i eventually got sick of sitting around all day. 

i taught myself to code became a jr developer at a retail company. now i'm working for a big tech company. some days i'm happy but most times i just fell tired. when i think back on what i've experienced i feel like i'm dead. these days i don't even remember when i ate, or what projects i have to do this week. work becomes the only distraction for me. i don't leave my room. and these days i feel content with passing away.

"life is playing cat and mouse with me and i can't keep being teased and punished anymore.this year has a pattern for me: i'm more miserable than i've ever been in my life, i get something that makes it better, and then that something gets ripped away and i'm twice as miserable and hopeless as i was before. 

the initial lockdown happened, and i had to go back home and live with my parents, who i swore i'd never live with again. but at least i had my cat, who i got right before lockdown and gave me a reason to wake up every day - and then my cat died suddenly and unexpectedly the month of my birthday, which was already a huge depression trigger for me because i'm 24 and still a virgin. that was when i first planned to kill myself - i wrote a note and everything. but then, things turned around. i met a guy online and we started talking. he was actually interested in me, the first person in years, basically the first person ever. we had \*so much\* in common. we talked for hours on the phone every night. i convinced my parents to let me fly back to my apartment, was settling in, life was good - until my job got cut to part-time in a really demanding sector (entertainment), a month before my lease was up. my boss told me it was partially due to covid, but it was also clearly partially due to my performance, because i never adjusted well to wfh and then the death of my cat sent me spiraling into the deepest depression i've ever been in. she wasn't going to write me a recommendation. i was panicked and distressed and sure it was over. but then, things turned around. after three weeks of applying, i got a miracle job that paid way better than my old one and was a career step up. i found a new, better apartment in a new, better neighborhood that was close to my new job. i moved. the boy and i made plans to visit each other safely, and he told me all the time how much he thought about me, how much he couldn't wait to meet me, how much he wanted to be together.

and then, the day before i was supposed to go visit him, i was fired out of nowhere. my boss told me i'd made mistakes but didn't tell me what they were when i asked. they didn't give me a warning, written or verbal. i was just asked to leave in the middle of the day on a thursday, because apparently i'd fucked up that badly. i got a uti and couldn't have sex during the weekend the guy and i spent together. the weekend seemed fine, but afterwards, he got distant. he told me he wanted to keep things casual, even though we were talking about anniversaries and meeting my parents a week ago. he doesn't text me anymore. i told him to tell me if his feelings had changed, but he insists we're fine while he ghosts me. i have to move out of the apartment i never fully moved into at the end of december. i have no roommates, so i'm alone all day, every day.  and now i'm sick (not with covid, thank god) on thanksgiving, with the worst cold i've had in my life, lying around in my silent apartment, counting down the days until i pack my bags and go home as a failure.

now, after christmas, i'm about to go back home, again. this time for good. my already meager savings were totally drained by the move. my boyfriend is clearly done with me. and by the time there's a vaccine and i can maybe move back to la to pursue my industry again, the market will be flooded by newer, cheaper graduates who are hungrier than me. this is it. it's over. there's nothing left for me anymore. i feel like this is rock bottom, but life is going to plunge me even further and deeper down to a new rock bottom. my romantic life is a long string of people who were briefly interested and then dumped me when it came time to actually commit; my career is dead; i'm broke and isolated and a failure. today, my aunt and uncle called me and i didn't tell them i was fired, because how do you admit how badly you've failed? i'm calling friends 24/7 just to fill up space in my apartment with noise, but i can tell they're already getting frustrated with how whiney i am. soon, they'll be done with me. i will be a single, sexless, friendless parasite on my parents for the rest of my life.

the only conclusion is that god is punishing me. i'm not even religious, would qualify myself as an atheist if asked, but that has to be true. it's all too clinical, too precise, too designed to not only make me miserable but make me miserable in the most grueling way possible. i don't know what new misery the world has in store for me. i don't know what there is left to take away. but i don't plan on finding out: i'm not going to stick around and let myself get happy, only to have it yanked away again. happiness is a temporary condition now, and i'd be a moron to fall for it again. i'm taking pills with whiskey tonight, or maybe tomorrow. my boyfriend will see it as a relief, my parents will grieve but will eventually realize it's better for them financially, and my friends will get over it. tell god he fucking wins. he broke me. i'm done.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"it's no ones fault i wanted to be an artisthello suicide watch,   
  i am 25 years old and still living at home.  i had moved out previously but that only lasted a couple years as i couldn't afford it.  i feel like the life that i have chosen has been a blessing and a curse.  on days where i am not plagued by depression i do enjoy playing music and painting.  i was working as a house painter for the past five years but then i faced the reality of not being able to follow my dreams as i would like to so i've been trying to do it with little to no money picking up jobs scarily.  i do not produce enough art work to sell and i also don't learn a lot of covers to play out and make money, which i know i'm shooting myself in the foot.  i just genuinely want to make something that i can call my own.  when i was younger i felt that i had the potential/work ethic to be someone but i never hit my stride and i feel like i am becoming a loser despite my efforts.  i don't have many friends and don't really know how to make friends being out of school for so long.  i'm practically unemployed and every time i think of applying for one i'm held back by thoughts of having little to no social skills.  this also adds a sense of shame because i can never create without thinking that i don't have a real job so it adds some guilt because what i consider working(art/music) isn't physical or a means to a paycheck.  i was in a really bad episode a few months ago where i couldn't make myself get out of bed but i currently write this as someone who is drifting.  as i grow older i realize that my world view is getting more limited and i can't seem to leave my childlike perspective.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i cannot believe how much i changed.i just want to confide myself, it can be complex to read and follow but i’m full to my throat, i cannot fight anymore.

i do not know where to start, i guess i need to start from somewhere.

my father and mother divorced when i was 4, this was not a big deal till i start to elementary school, all of my friends’ family was happy and together, while my father was having fun with his russian girlfriends and wasnt caring about me. i seek for a father figure till then, i admit that my father helped me a lot in case of a financial help but never in emotional way, he always compared me with my cousins and told me that he wished i would be like them, at least he could feel the feeling of a son. we barely talked and all of them were about my financial needs, nothing else. also, he shamed me because of my feminine soul, annnnddd, i’m still having problems with talking with boys as you know, i’m insecure about myself, because of that son of a bitch.

i’m afraid of expressing my feelings too; you know, people would make fun of me, laugh at me when i tell them what i’m thinking. because of this fear, i’ve become a liar, i lie about my feelings, my fears and ideas. just to protect myself from hatred and jokes. i even hide my sexual orientation from everyone. in fact, i’m bisexual but as you would guess, i pretend to be a straight. i hide my sexual experiences with guys, even from my current girlfriend. only my best friends know this and it hurts me. 

another thing is, i hate my country, i live in turkey and i’m really sick of this ugly country. everytime i open the news, i see different kind of rape, assault, abuse and our dictator’s shitty talks. i just can’t handle this, i cannot believe that people can be that bad, it depresses me. literally everything in this country. our dying economy, our asshole president, shitty citizens. everything. i’m really tired of thinking about my future, i’m really tired of this anxiety. 

there’s a lot of that i did not mentioned but you know, confessing all those things to someone, and even myself started to hurt me. 

briefly, i missed the old me; i was cheerful, funny and happy person. i used to spread happiness to all around me, i was strong enough to hide my problems and deal with them. i had a will to live, at least more than today. but currently, i lost’em all. i act really bad towards the people around me, i delay all my programs, trying to escape from my responsibilities and avoid to talk with people, even my precious mom. i had never been thought about suicide in my life but now, i’m considering it sometimes and cannot help it. i want to live but i’m not strong enough to do so. there are people who is having worse things than mine and i’m still complaining about myself. i’m a mess, i’m just a weak ass. i do not deserve to be alive.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"each day i'm getting more and more ready to commit.i was a spoiled child. i'd usually get what i asked for. i was able to avoid uncomfortable acts like chores and get straight to enjoyable things that wasted my time. i was somehow innately smart enough to get straight b's in all subjects without putting in effort.

then came the next level of education, and i was unprepared for the amount of effort required. i had not learned to really get hurting to succeed, like an athlete would when they're running on the treadmill trying to go further. many around me had this grit, this ability to put up with bullshit to get what they want. i just flaked, and came out with no grades.

that was 6 years ago. i knew then i wouldn't be seeing university. i would have to find a job and hope it went somewhere. 

after a year or so i had become depressed. i was sent by others to my doctor, to a therapist. after some time i was sending myself. i've had the support of a wealth of doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, psychologists, voluntary organisations, friends, family and employers. 

after every intervention it's the same: i feel better for a short while then fall right back into realising just how bullshit everything is, and i still don't have that grit needed to face the bullshit. 

after all of this i can see that there's no cure for pain or even a treatment, and to some extent i just have to man up if i want to get somewhere in life like out of my parents' house. sure medication can change some feelings and therapy can help put things into a structure, but none of it will prepare me for the inevitable pain of the marathon ahead. 

i've learned that to get by you have to be willing to take the pain of life. you have to commit. i'm not willing, but there's another choice that takes just as much commitment and is just as frightening: the commitment to throw it all away forever. in this i don't get any pain, that's for the people around me who care about me. every day that passes i feel more ready to commit. i have my plans, i can visualise them, i just need to do it.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i still think about it whenever i'm the first car stopped at an intersectioni thought i had put these kinds of thoughts behind me. but i still get them.

i'll be driving and everything will be fine. automatic. easy. but then the light will turn and i'll slow to a stop and i'll be the first one waiting for the light to change. where i live, every intersection is big and busy. when the cars start rushing across in front of me, i get this *itch*. this nagging voice in my head that it'd be so easy just to let my foot slip on the brake and inch out. or maybe slam on the gas and sent myself rocketing into traffic. and it'd be over. and i wouldn't have to worry about the consequences anymore. i wouldn't have to worry about the little things. bills, work, cleaning, medical insurance. i could just be free of it.

or sometimes, i think about how easy it would be to swerve just a little bit and wrap myself around a tree. how it could be chalked up to me texting while driving. or having a seizure, or just being careless.

i dream about it too. for a while, i wasn't sure what exactly the dreams were about, but i think i know now. i get these dreams where i slamming my foot down harder and harder but my van can't or won't stop in time and i slam into traffic. i just realized the other night though that it isn't about me slamming on the breaks-- it's about me slamming on the gas.

my fiance used to bug me all the time about how i'm terrible about going out and doing errands without her. part of the truth of it is, driving scares me. and she knows i hate driving so she lets it slide a lot. but the bigger truth of it is, i'm scared of myself. i'm scared i'm going to do something stupid.

i told her years ago about it. but i think like me she had hoped it was something in the past. i'm not going to tell her that i still feel this way. i burden her with shit constantly, she doesn't need that on her mind too.

i used to think that i'd be lucky to make it to adulthood. failing that, i wasn't sure i'd make it to my 21st birthday. and younger me thought for sure i wouldn't make it out of my 20's.

things are a lot better now. i'm 21, and in some ways i like myself a lot more than i used to. but i think i'm a bit more fucked up than i'm wiling to admit. my family has very few health problems. physically, we tend to live long lives. but god damn does crazy run on every single side of my family. when i confided in my momma as a teenager that i thought i might have depression, she brushed me off. she then went on to start antidepressants a couple years later. i know i should probably be on them too. they'd probably help some. but for the life of me i can't admit to myself that i need them, no matter how much my life starts to spiral out of control in the little ways. my health insurance situation is a mess, and i can't afford to get meds right now. and i dissolve into a panic attack whenever i even think about trying to set up an appointment.

anyways.

i don't know if anyone feels the same way. but i needed to get this off my chest. because i've been struggling the last couple weeks.

"to moderators for r/teenagers i have been working hard to make relatable memes for my fellow teenagers, but they seem to be a poaching bot that doesn’t allow pre made formats. i feel like the addition to u/magic_eye_bot was nice because it eliminates possible reposting, but the bot just completely removes any post with pre-made templates. 

for example: i have uploaded 3 different memes that i made with mematic, which were (not fully) origional content. i used a template and psoted my fresh relatable meme about a school scenario, and poof. 1 minute later, my post was removed because of: “identical or slihtly modified image recently posted here”. i think you should have the bots programmming reconstructed so the bot can depict the difference between text colour, position and other tags on post, so the meme doesn’t get taken down because of possible repost. im honeslty so mad about this because i see other memes using the template get posted, and not taken down.

all my life i have been living sub-par, i guess you could say. i've never bothered to try my hardest, to be the best, and subsequently i have not been. i've never tried too hard in school and managed to keep good grades, up until this year, my sophomore year in high school. i've never reached my full potential and this saddens me. i've always been afraid of sharing my emotions with others. i have never been myself. i've always followed other examples and have never truly tried to be myself. now its really starting to hit me hard. i was always the class-clown, the outgoing kid who didn't care of your opinion of him and always had a good time. now, i'm the quiet kid who is only happy when he smokes a couple joints. i don't know what i have become, because i have never been me. i broke up with my girlfriend of 9 months because of a bet with a friend, over a soccer game. that was the biggest regret of my life. i try so hard to be accepted. i see what other people have done, and lived for and can not reflect on my own life and remember one moment, one instance, where i was 'successful' or on top. i haven't even been in shape for 3 years or so. i don't think i have any true friends either anymore. i have to call them to hang out, to make plans. the only time my phone goes off is when my dealer is good. my mom is worried for me, as my grades are slipping and my depression is becoming more evident. my whole life i've dedicated to fitting in, but i guess as you grow older you see the light, but it's hard to break old habits. the saddest part, is that i don't even know who i am, what i like, who i admire, because i've always followed the crowd. sometimes i feel as though i could die and someone would only notice when my professor calls my name during roll call. i don't have any motivation to do homework and have a c average. it's crazy to think that i will have a future. if my motivation to talk to new people now is gone, it sure as hell won't come back. i can't even stand up for myself. i'm sure people know i'm weak. i escape reality when i can with different drugs, usually weed. what bothers me the most is that i can't pinpoint why i feel the need to escape. is it my father who lives halfway across the world and won't give me the time of day? the same father who would call me and tell me to get ready, and that he was going to come pick me up, and would never show. maybe, it's my step-father who would use force as a disciplinary tool. compared to others, i haven't even had a rough life.  i guess this also proves i'm weak. i can't believe i don't even know who i am. i'm too scared to ask for help, that's for sure. i've always been a fan of easy escapes. my mother must feel the real, hard pain. to see a perfect reflection of my father every time she looks into my eyes. the same pathological liar, and thief. my father used to steal my grandmother's gold from her jewelry box. now i'm stealing things i can sell for weed. i guess that is me, my personality. to the world i have been more of an annoyance, than a joy. what's my motivation supposed to be anyways? get good grades, work hard, and maybe one day i'll have the courage to talk to someone new. fuck that. the world has never done me any justice, so why should i do it any. i'm not a person, i'm a shadow.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"had a huge mental breakdown two hours ago because of several things that happened throughout the day.my day started of quite bad. i got called by my best friend (male) at midnight. he sounded totally shitfaced. there were a lot of background noise and a lot of talking. he asked me if i was awake and alone at 00:15. which i said ""yes?"" to. i had no idea what was going on. then all of a sudden a girl started talking to him and hung up the phone. cue panic attack. like wtf was that all about. i texted him ""okay?"" about fifteen minutes later.

around five i woke up because i felt like i was going to throw up and saw that i had two unread messages from him. in an almost unreadable text he said ""huh, have i called you? oof"" (translated from another language).

i wasn't able to sleep for almost an hour because ya ""boi"" had another panic attack while in bed.

then i woke up at around 14:45 i woke up because i had to pee. dropped my phone on my way to the bathroom and found out that my bank card is gone. (card is supposed to be in the little pocket on the case). went upstairs to tell mom, while having a full on panic attack, only to find my aunt and grandmother in the living room. guess who decided to invite family over for dinner without telling me (and mom).

i have been diagnosed with autism, so the change in my plans caused an even bigger panic attack. yay me.

three hours later (after dinner), a different ""friend"" sent me a long video of him lip syncing to ""make you mine"" by public. i hate getting videos of him. it makes me sick to my stomach. you may think ""what's the problem here?"". he's in his thirties. i'm still a couple of years away from 20. i've told him so many times i don't want him as a boyfriend. (1 because of age difference. 2 we live in different countries. 3 i'm into girls.)

so anyway, after i had to painstakingly watch my way through that video, i sent him a snap saying ""i do not enjoy videos from you"". he read it wrong and thought i said that i do enjoy getting videos from him. se sent the video in chat and saved it together with a cheesy paragraph basically saying ""since you loved the video so much i'll save it here so you can watch it whenever you're feeling down. i love you lots.""
after i corrected him, he got all sad and said ""well shit 💔"". i muted him again at that point.

a few hours passed and i thought that was it for the day, but oh boy were i wrong. i watched a r/wholesomememes video by the click. i thought it'd make me happy, but it just made me cry more and more. that's what happens when you bottle up emotions for months. at the end of the video i was just full on ugly crying. i put on my favourite album by xxxtentacion, as you do when you see no end to your suffering. i ended up ugly crying for half an hour while listening to 17 on repeat.

after i cleaned up my tears and blew my nose, i just sat at my bed for a while. tried to watch videos, but i just felt dead. no spark in my eyes, no smile, no laughter, no emotion. just dead, but breathing.

then i cut myself. once, twice, more and more, the blood started dripping quicker and quicker. i stopped and got some paper towels because, ya know, don't want to leave any blood on the clean bedsheets.

if i could do one thing, it would to be happy. not hey, life is pretty ok right now, but ecstatic, and every moment better than this next. why am i unhappy? i have no fucking reason to be unhappy. none, i went to therapy and they asked me about an event that could of triggered this and i couldn't think of a god damn thing. i see everyone around me dealing with life, and i can't. i just can't cope with it. i have gotten to age 19 by turning everything off. i constantly distract myself. right now i'm feeling my stomach ripped apart by despair. so i self medicate, and try to forget everything. if i have a bad thought i push it out of my head, if i don't think about it, it doesn't exist, and i truly do believe that. i have been on a slew of antidepressants, and not one did a fucking thing. i eventually lied after the 6th new pill bottle and said i was doing better for years. finally took myself off and started doing drugs to fucking dissociate myself from the world. i push everything, and everyone away. right now i have exactly zero friends to talk to, besides people i've met online through video games, which by the way is just another way for me to forget about life. i don't even consider myself a loser, it's just that i don't see the point. i've set a date to kill myself, because i want to do this as rationally as i can. hopefully by then i have a changed heart, but for 7 years i have wanted this so i don't see it happening, i came here to vent and try to help myself, so thanks for you're time.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i am sick.i am sick.

to a point where my mind can no longer think, just to protect myself from what my memories and thoughts it might conjure.

to a point where i've lead such a solitary life and developed an idealogy just to maximize my pain and live alone.

i am sick.

nobody cares about you, it is only when you, have nothing to offer to their gain.

nobody loves you, only when they do, you leave them to, protect them, but mostly you.

i am sick.

i eat nothing but junk, do nothing but sit and watch, distract myself from it all.

i cry, scream, preach, yell, whimper for help, but when anyone rare enough to see something so obscure and unimportant and reach out to me, i refuse.

i am sick.

i hate myself, i love myself. i live, but i don't want to. i want to end my suffering, but the pain is there because i want it to be there. i want to stop being in pain, yet i really don't want to.

nothing i do will see anyone's face. nothing i do will matter to anyone except me. no matter how loud you cry, no matter how much pain you are in, no matter how much you hate life to rebel against how unfair it is, life doesn't own you anything. life will not justify anything. life will hate you, life will push you, kick you, and expect you to master it, with no reward other than meaningless artificial feelings and emotions your brain produces.

i am sick.

i am tired.

i can't hold it anymore. i want to kill, and i want to die. i want to put others in pain, i want to put myself in pain. i want to die, yet i still live. i am tired.

i am sick, and tired.

i beg you for mercy, to please end it, from my miserable existence.

i beg you for mercy, to please cover my eyes and tell me that it's okay.

i beg you for mercy, to please tell me that i am nothing more than a meaningless wall of text that offers nothing to anyone except boredom, and that you'll do me the good of not making me exist any more.

"i'm close.i think about killing myself on a daily basis. i have been having these thoughts for the past couple months now. the only thing that is stopping me right now are my children. and when i say the only thing, i really mean, that's it. sometimes though, i feel like maybe they would be better off without me anyway. they deserve someone better anyway. 

my husband cheated on me with one of my family members. he apologized and has been trying hard to make it up to me. that's not even really all of it though. my family knew and never told me. a lot (well, almost everyone) in my life has completely lied to me about this. i have absolutely no one in my life (with the exception of my kids) that are really there for me, or care about me. i come from a big family and to find this out and have my life completely change, has been so damaging. 

i think about ways to do this, so my kids will not find me or anyone else. i think i should just have them stay with a sibling and then come back to my house and before i hang myself, call the police, so no one but them, finds me.

"my decisioni need to stop writing this, just gonna post it.

i'm going to kill myself.

i'm going to fall.

i'm going to do it after seeing my mental health counselor early next week.

it's better that i die.

this isn't my first time planning my end.  i faced a decision when i turned 20 to either kill myself or take action on my transgender feelings which had been plaguing me since… about as long as i can remember.  i went into it knowing damn near everything about the process, having researched it extensively.  i've tried keeping my expectations low knowing how unreasonable expectations can cause problems.

i'm 24 now.  i was on hormones for most of the last four years, making little progress.  at this point i can't even afford them.  i've been taking my expired spironolactone in a desperate attempt to keep my testosterone down.  i don't believe it possible for me to come to terms with my body.

i pick my skin severely, mostly on my right arm, stomach, face, and legs from torso to knees.  this started in high school, which was quite stressful.  i mostly pick in the bathroom, which has been a constant source of stress as long as i can remember.  i have issues pooping, or, well, wiping.  i wipe until i feel clean, inspecting the toilet paper after each wipe.  typically the toilet paper is blooded by the time i'm done wiping.  family and friends have noticed this behavior, at one point friends made it a unit of time measurement in school.  i've given this an awful lot of attention throughout my life, developing as efficient a system as i could to minimize it's impact.  i use exactly two pieces of toilet paper per wipe, wrapped around three fingers twice, if it's not terribly messy you can fold it again after the first wipe for a second.  spitting on the toilet paper also does wonders (for the baby wipes folks or whoever).  i'm sorry about the detail.

i'm incredibly bothered by farting, i make every effort to fart on a toilet.

i have many friends who are wonderful and genuinely care for me.  i can't talk to any of them about any of my problems.  i can't burden them.  i hate to burden anyone.  i'm scared if i don't kill myself i'll end up burdening the people i care about more and more.  i can't allow that possibility.

i've been seeing a counselor person since i was planning on killing myself last, some months ago.  i was talked into going to an emergency room by a suicide hotline.  misinformed that they wouldn't be able to hold me against my will.  once i was informed i did everything in my power to fight it.  i don't feel there's any coming back from that point.  i am terrified of loosing control of my life.  with the intervention of some friends they settled on getting me into an outpatient program with a promise that i wouldn't kill myself in the interim.

i don't feel the counselor has helped, or the doctor i've been seeing for meds.  i've never believed much in medication.  they initially had me on citalopram, which has apparently shown efficacy in treating dermatillomania.  i didn't feel that was helping, and didn't particularly enjoy the side effects.  they now have me on lamotrigine.

i hate myself for all the stupid decisions i've made.  from 18 to 23 i've been employed as a web developer, offered an internship with the school district following a programming class which was largely php and moving on to better jobs after that.  i was making more than my parents, i had money saved, i felt secure in that aspect of my life.

then i lost my job.  i wasn't fired, the company ran into financial trouble.  i was told to get onto unemployment by my boss, and i started it the day after.  i didn't collect on any of it for the next 9 months, burning through my savings instead because of my obsession with not wanting to be one of those people who exploits the system.  i was just stupid.  i've been stupid a lot.

i've held a few jobs that didn't last long since then.  it's been very hard finding work.  i wasn't able to handle the stress of my last developer job.  i've completely lost faith in myself as a programmer.

while i hold no love for myself, i've done everything i could for others, to the best of my abilities.  i've been doing an older neighbors laundry for a long time because she has trouble, i've tried to not let her pay me, but she insists.  she is wonderful.  she is concerned for me and frustrated by my behavior, which is entirely reasonable.  this is why i can't share with people, it just hurts them more.

i never know what to fucking say.  i've never shared this much before.  it's not like i haven't tried to get over this… i know i'm weak… but i'm not entirely without hope, or i wouldn't post here in the first place.  (and i like the idea of leaving at least my own written account of myself somewhere, however much not touched on.)

"before i go, a word of advice about hanging yourselfthis isn't a post informing you how to hang yourself but how it feels and what the pain is like but if this gets removed, it won't matter. i'll probably be dead already. this is, i guess for educational purposes, for anyone considering hanging themselves.

it's not pleasant but you've guessed that already. you're probably prepared for the pain but i can tell you that the pain is much different then you imagine. it's the weight of your whole body on the upper part of your neck.

breathing isn't hard at first but you will gasp for air anyway, making the pain on your jaw and upper neck worse. the pain is horrid. you will start to struggle, even if you don't want to. you will try and get loose. it hurts and you're still conscious, you just want to be over but you're still very conscious.

people say you think about loved ones when you are dying but when you're hanging you just want to breathe. that's all that's on your mind. just taking a breath and stopping the pain. you feel something break before you'll hear it, a small pop or even a crack.

that's when i got myself down, permanent damage to my throat and bruising all over my neck. hanging is fucking painful.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my previous narc ex destroyed me, and now my current gf has left me and i am struggling to find a point in all of thisi lost my career earlier this year because of my narcissistic ex that spread rumors about me once i posted an image of my current gf of two years on my story... these rumors were about sexual abuse but i never heard any details except for the fact that around 40 of my network acquaintances just dropped me over the course of a couple weeks. 
this got me hospitalized due to depression and suicidal tendencies. i lost more and more freelance work, went from being the provider to one month needing help from my gf to pay rent.

later went to start a new education for something i thought’d be fun. it ended up being interesting but stressed me out to the point where i couldn’t give close to any attention to my gf. on top of that i still had freelance work left over to do. our previous problems on my end that were caused in part due to my narcissistic ex’s sabotage of me started to flare up again and the emotional attraction faded...

my gf tried to break us up a couple times telling me i was a narcissist, which i agreed to and have been working on for a good while by reading stories of narc abuse. i just held on for dear life until the day after my birthday (the 17th this month) when i cried my heart out, apologized for everything i put her through and gave her the break up she wanted. she never got introspective or apologized for anything she did but it didn’t matter... i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

i left for my apartment the next day, almost jumped in front of the subway, fell onto the floor as i got home, cried like i’ve never cried before and once i couldn’t cry i took the closest metal object, my keys, and started grinding my wrist til it bled. i’ve never actually gone ahead and self harmed all the way before... but it would never get deep enough so i stopped and just lay there motionless.

then my mother called because my gf who i just left told her to check in on me. i guess she really did care after all...

i’ve spent every day since hating myself, crying to myself saying if i fuck up something as nice as my gf that i don’t deserve to live or be happy or to move on with my life. and i believe it. i barely eat.

my gf, now ex, is giving me the cold shoulder and minimal contact treatment which i understand. and i’ve had friends every other day to lean on and talk to.

but i just don’t want to go on. i’ve had two meals in the last three days and i’m in bed until 3pm every day even though i wake up at nine. i have even more work to do now and start school again in two weeks. i’ve lost so much weight, used to be in fighting shape for martial arts... i see no way out of this

i am a man in my 40's, i am an inventor who has been targeted by 2 furries, a racing competition came into town, the prize was becoming the ruler of the planet so i entered myself and my 2 autistic robots into the race, i told them i would shine their threads if they brought me victory.

they asked how.

i told them to just:

then i replied with ""that's not a problem!
i've only just begun to cheat
i'm certain i'll do some more~!""

i replied with ""of course, you idiot!

i will probably get a lot of hate from here anyway.

i was just outed as a pedophile. now to be clear i have never touched a child in a sexual manner i even go to therapy every week. i was just born with sexual attraction to prepubescent and i hate it. i don't want this, if i could change it trust me i would.

anyway, awhile ago i accidentally made a post on this account instead of my alt account i had made for the post. the post was a confession letter, even my therapist thought it would be a good idea to write it all down, well i was drunk and didn't switch to my alt account. after finally realizing i had posted it on the wrong account i deleted it. however someone had a screen shot, and gave this screen shot to someone that is a tad vindictive bc i made fun of her in modmail on another sub. she posted it, now its climbing on /r/drama 

if this was a completely anon account it wouldn't be a big deal, but there are people in my real life that know i am toucan, they know this account. they will see it and most if not all will not be friendly about it, one of them i even work with, will i even still have a job soon?

what will happen when my family finds out?

the internet was the one place i could create a new persona for myself and get away from the shit hand that the world dealt me irl, i've spent years being this person and now that's been taken from me.

so that's really the deal now, my life is going to burn down around me so why stick around to watch it right? people like me are fucked up in the head and probably shouldn't exist in the first place right? surely it's only a matter of time before i hurt someone.

"unhappy - never felt so alonethrowaway account

husband is planning on making my life hell unless i divorce him. i can’t just leave because the car brakes  went out and he makes a lot more money than i do. it would be easier just to not exist and before anyone says people will miss me. i have no friends or family to help. i do have classmates who may help but i don’t want to bring drama in their lives. my mom is unable to help due to mental illness and financial instability. because of her mental illness, she is the meanest person to be around.

i never felt so alone. i thought marriage would change him. he threatens he will find my parents and harm them. i don’t know what to do. i’m in my early twenties if that helps. does anyone know any resources that could help? if not then, it’s better if i’m just gone. i don’t have anyone to talk to or trust which is why i am writing on here. 

i really don’t want to die because i will get promoted within three months and i know i will one day be able to afford to take care of myself... i have been dreaming of leaving him once i go away for my internship but i don’t want to wait 8 more months of living like this.i’ve been suicidal my whole life but i do value my life.

i made the mistake of not breaking things off after he cheated or hit me. i regret this whole marriage... i do have money on my lyft gift card so i can lyft somewhere safe and a suitcase to pack. if i do anything, i don’t want it to be in the home where it would remind him everyday.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i need advice, ideas... i don't know... i need help.i'm in a situation that i don't see a way out. 

1- i graduated in 2015 in law school, but i'm not very good in it... i can't find a job because i don't have experience, and i don't have experience because i did not work in behalf of my mom, that i had to take care. 

2- i don't have money to do anything. i can't start a new universety or mba, i can't go to another city or country...

3- my mother is dying with cancer and my father with 3 aneurisms 

4- my sister have mental problems, and do stuff that you can't even imagine. she tried to kill my parents, tried to put the house on fire, and my parents does not do anything, because it's their doughter. 

5- i'm in a relationship, she is way smater that i am (in law school at least) she will graduated soon, and i fear that if don't find something to do with my life, she might broke up with me. not that she said something, but you might understand what i'm saying. 

6- what do i do? i am really creative, but i don't see a way out. i think that i should wait, and after my parents die, i should kill myself. what would i do? 

7- i used to do stand up comedy, i have an award for it, but i don't see how to get money with it, and i don't see how to start again. my country is in a crysis, with more that 13 million people unemplyed. to start anything was never harder. and without money... well... 

8- there is heavy pressure over my head. everyone is charging me (is this the correct word?) about jobs or sutudy but there is no solution. there is no jobs, and to study alone wont't take me anywhere. and well, right now i'm not in the mood for it

9- i tought about youtube or something, but everone think about it these days and i don't even know how to edit videos. and i'm way too depressed to be funny again. 

10- last year i made a medical exam because of a headache, and it said that i had a degenerative disease in my brain, i was already ok about dying, but then the other exam that i did, said that was nothing (i don't know how so much difference) but well, my headache is back.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i stuck with it, i lost 50 lbs and got back into school and got great grades. last tuesday however i ended up getting into a fight on campus. they swung first, i took the guy down and his friend ran in and started sucker punching me in the side of the head while i was on top of the guy. despite this the police are doing an investigation and they said that i might be getting some charges, i have to meet with the crl of my school this week and find out what the consequences are for this. 

in 2012 i got in legal trouble at this same school and ended up leaving. i lost everything, my previous fiance left me (she just married another guy last weekend btw,) i had to leave school, i became homeless, i started abusing drugs, and i made a suicide attempt that caused some brain damage. eventually i got my stuff expunged, got clean, and worked my ass off to get back to where i could function. i worked my ass off to get back here. i always swore if this happened again i would kill myself. it's happening again.",suicide,suicide,1.0

we were together for 6 years. we had our ups and downs, mainly through my fault, but we were so good together. i got a job in the usa from europe and decided to pursue it and that she would come along later. we were going to get married so she could join me. after 6 weeks of being apart i stopped caring and gave up on her. i ended it with her. she was devastated. i refused to take her back. 

i was upset and wanted to take her back, but needed time to think. then 5 weeks later it sunk in: i'd felt so distant from her and i was overworking, so i made a bad decision, but she is my one and only. there can never anyone else. 

but it was too late. she hates me. she hates us. shes hates i left. she's happy now without me. she has a new bf already. she won't talk to me, except to discuss the money i owe her. she blocks me when i beg.

and that's it. my stupid action destroyed my love. neither of us did anything wrong. i just wasn't thinking straight.

well it's been more weeks. i dream of her every night. i dream she's taken me back and i break down and cry. but when i wake up she's gone.

i've been depressed before. the worst is when you no longer fear ending your life, it just feels normal and natural. i'm reaching that point. i think about it all the time. i'm almost ready. i can't stay alive for the people around me, i'm sorry. i can't feel this pain constantly with no future and no hope. i feel like it's all been leading up to this point. the only thing keeping me going is the hope she'll change her mind. soon i'll message her and ask if there is any way she'll just use a conversation with me if i come home. if not i think i'll call that it. she won't agree to meet me though. i know.

and i’ll rape their son. i’ll rape his little ass. i’ll brake his jaw by how hard i’ll be making him suck me. after the jaws broke, i’ll rip it off. and i’ll dump both of their bodies right on the streets of manhattan. let everyone see. 

back to father. electrocution and and adrenaline shots for day. cut off his nose and feed it to him. beat him senseless. then, i’m gonna take one of those skinner trees, cut it down, and the trees diameter like a foot, and thrust and thrust until it goes thru the entire body. 

when i’m done, i’ll throw him in the kiddy pool. this is the best part. 4 fucking deep but can’t swim lol. i’m definitely gonna be masturbating to that one. and i’ll rape his dead body every day until he’s rotten. 

my mom and sister are different  they don’t have what i have. they are evil cunts for that. i know they can tell it, but fuck all humanity. now, it’s about me. i’m just gonna headshot then and leave them. 

i’ll walk through the town and rape every person i see. until they bleed and their sphincter rips apart. then i’m gonna find my psych. then the neuro, then the gp. 

i’m crushing on a girl right now. she’s cool. but i don’t know her like that. but on god, all i want to do is torture her in so many ways. cut her ear off and shove it up her ass, make her accept my shit in my mouth and swallow. fucking pain. it makes me want to cum so ducking hard. 

the idea of getting revenge like this, i’m literally having a boner as we speak. 

or maybe i should let one of them watch while i tear the other apart

but i digress. my solution:


1. shotgun to the brain. many many times until the face is unrecognizable. both mom and sister.

2. when i’m done killing all these people, i’ll feel normal again. and i would rather die than go with the cops. i’ll pick up some stuff and tell them to meet me at somewhere. when they walk in, i want them to see me covered in shit and piss while i jack my pathetic penis off and shove things in my ass

once i start this mission, there is no end. all or nothing. if i happen to see a woman in the middle of this? she’s getting brutally raped until she loses all her fucking blood which i’ll then wet my cock with. even better if there’s a kid. i’ll rip that shit out, and use his entire body as a flesh light. 

i’m finally ready. i’m more angry than i thought thong goal is to rape at least 10 cunts before i end it. i want to ruin more lives. and right up the asshole dry. 

christians believe that after some time in lergatorh, we go to heaven! yeah like all the serial killers and hitler and me after this happens? fuck off. 

fuck christianity. think for yourself you stupid fucking followers. a man can’t be the sin of a god. fuck your entire religion. because my uncle tried to sit and tell me everyone’s going to heaven ok. fucking faggot. 

i have the shells. i just need the gun. don’t even need to buy one, it’s at the other house. 

and to anyone who reads this far, fuck you honestky. i resent you for feeling better than me. if i could anally rape your mother i would. i would cut her up and fuck the resulting pile of mush while you watch. 

fuck you cunts. fuck this website. 

i hope all of your family members 1. die in a car accident 2. painful cancer 3. heart attack, burn to death. i wish they were all here because i would wipe my cock all over their newly formed stubbs. 

off yourself now. like i shoulda done 8years ago. back then i wasn’t this bad  i didn’t get immediately hard at the fact if toeturing my father. i wish i can givhis address. hill him. unironqkkh

"who else smokes ciggarretts because they are suicidal?i've always wondered this, especially after being unable to quit for many years because all i can think of is what is the point of quitting? since i'm going to die soon anyway and have wanted to die most of my life which makes it even harder to quit since i don't care about my health anymore. i know not everyone smokes for this reason. smoking is an addiction for nicotine, but it also kills a lot of people. and people smoke cigs knowing the possibility that they could get heart disease, lung cancer, other cancers etc; i am also aware it can take more than 40 years before someone has serious health problems, so it can be a pretty ineffective way to die if someone wants to kick the bucket quickly, but who else smokes it hoping it will kill them eventually? it can literally kill us and painfully too, yet we still fucking smoke!",suicide,suicide,1.0

"failing at everythingas the title suggests, i'm failing at literally everything. 

i feel like everyone i know is moving on with their lives. they are all getting married, having kids and excelling in their careers. i'm just falling further and further behind and i will never be able to catch up. 

a long time ago i came to terms with the fact that i will never get married and have kids - i'm okay with that. i mean i'm a little depressed about it, but overall i have accepted it.

the part i'm struggling more with is careers/money. once again i have always known that i would never be one of those successful people and i have accepted that. when i was younger my friends and i were earning similar amounts, it was easier to fit in and be included. now that my friends are earning much more than me (some double), it's becoming very hard to stay part of the group.

i've never been a person with a lot of friends and the older i get the more i lose. i'm also terrible at making friends and have not made a new friend in over 10 years. i have always known that eventually my few friends would leave me behind, but i guess i just hoped i had a few more years. 

i have come to dread socialising as i don't want people to focus on what a failure i am. it's very hard to sit at dinner when everyone else is talking about their fantastic lives, while i'm thinking about how much i hate my job and about how i hope they split the bill (i.e. i just pay for what i ate as i won't be able to afford it if they split the bill evenly over the table). 

i'm happy to hear about their lives and their successes (i'm just grateful that for the moment i'm still included), however out of politeness the conversation will eventually turn to me. am i seeing anyone? (no, still single). do i have any holidays planned? (no, i can barely afford the dinner we are eating, let alone go on a holiday). how is work? (same old, same old. i work in a call centre with no career prospects and every day i go to work hoping that i will get hit by a bus).

i know that friendships and give and take, but i have nothing to give/contribute. i feel like my friends are stuck with me and that i'm only still invited to things out of tradition/pity, not because they actually want to hang out with me. 

i think it would be easier if i just let my friends go, but then i would have any friends at all and i don't know if i'm ready for that. i'm already that person that dreads monday mornings because your colleagues ask you what you did on the weekend (i'm broke and barely have any friends so i stayed home and watched netflix). 

i have tried to do some extra study to see if i can get a better job, but it's just impossible. i'm unable to get a job because i don't have experience, but i'm unable to get experience because i can't get a job. even just basic jobs (that want me to have 5 years experience) pay $10,000 less than what i earn at the call centre. which is already a good $20,000 to $40,000 less than my friends. 

i just don't know what to do anymore. i think it's time to just cut my friends out (for their sake as much as mine). i'm seriously considering trying to kill myself, but i'm scared that i will fail at that too. 

i just don't want to exist anymore. i just want to be gone.

she decided to just go for it. she kept making noises as if she were trying to evade cars on the highway without brakes. at the end i hear **oooh!** she got whatever she wanted and the doritos fell. yeah. i just randomly remembered that.

"i saw someone else got hung up on too &amp; it made me remember thisnovember 4th. 2016.
i recently turned 16 that september and things were looking up for me. i was planning to get my license in a few weeks, started school and was doing amazing so far, adopted a lovely cat, was making amazing money on a pt job. 
it all came crashing down in october, when my first boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me. i’ll save that sappy shit for another time, like me sitting in a rainy parking lot where he left me and how i cried and screamed on the ground until the police showed up. 
our relationship was doomed from the beginning, but i will not discuss that.
from october 7th-november 4th i was in the hospital every night for suicide attempts. overdoses, alcohol poisoning, self harm, reckless driving (with stolen car - charges dropped), and then my biggest attempt.

i dropped out of school, stopped eating, lost so much weight in one month and i had no energy to even shower or do other basic hygiene things. i’ll say it, i hit rock bottom and my heart ached every single day. around this time too i started sleeping around because i did not care anymore, i was raped at a party a few nights after my ex broke up with me, and the only thing i wanted was to die.
i remember laughing while blood sprayed from my wrist.

november 4th.
i had to take a 2 hour bus ride to see my psychiatrist, who, also is the biggest idiot in the world and did absolutely nothing to help me. i was blind to any help back then, but i know to this day he made the situation much worse. i had a bottle of vodka in my bag, along with zoplicone (for those who are not familiar-sleeping pills) 7.5mg. i was told anything over it was an overdose, but isn’t anything over the intended dosage an overdose? i saved up pills for two weeks straight. my dad handed me one every night, i hid it under my tongue. 
7.5mg x 14 days = 105mg
prior to this, the night i was raped i had two with me and along with a few shots, i got completely blackout drunk with no memory whatsoever. i slept 20 hours at the hospital that night.
so i had two weeks worth of sleeping pills on me, i called my dad around 1pm (after my appointment) and was so happy. i said “i’ll be home soon. i love you” what i mean’t was home in heaven, with my brothers, and hopefully soon i’d get to see my love and we’d be together again
yea my head wasn’t screwed on right.
i shut off my phone, and used my music phone for the sad songs. i headed to a west vancouvers park with cliffs, got there around 5pm already drunk and crying my eyes out. i started to take pills one by one and got completely messed up.
i phoned kids help phone,
i was crying my eyes out like never before. i said “i don’t wanna die, i want my baby to come back, i just want him please please please” i was chugging back vodka like it was cold water on a summers day. 
my memory is a bit fuzzy now, but i remember the counsellor clearing saying “well there’s nothing i can do. i hope you get the help you need and i’m going to hang up now, have a great night! bye” and that was it. i kept trying to cut him off with “but-“ and “please” but he talked over me. when he hung up, i threw my phone into the water. i didn’t give a single fuck anymore, i blasted music via my other phone and a small speaker, smoked, and let the breeze cool my tears. i could barely stand, i screamed his name and how much i loved him, i screamed bloody murder for what felt like hours. 
there was million dollar homes within a km of me, so i’m guessing they all heard me. i heard sirens, but i knew they’d have to drive 20 minutes from a main highway in order to get to me.

i finished the last drop of the vodka, downed a couple more pills (i think i took about 8-10 total) and with all the strength i had i stood up, i said “i’ll be with you soon. i love you so much, im so sorry, please let me be safe until im with you” and i jumped off a cliff. i didn’t know this at the time, but there was huge rocks at the bottom and its a mircle i didnt hit any of them. 
i went so far into the water, i swear i touched the bottom, i just remember thinking “its okay im dying now”
i’ve been a swimmer all my life, and due to some pool parties i have experience swimming drunk. but the waves were so strong, the water was below freezing, and it was pitch black outside and i was losing the will to fight.
i swam up, gasped for air and screamed before a wave crashed on me and i got knocked out cold. they think i hit a rock.

vancouvers search &amp; rescue found me blue, low pulse, and presumed broken neck. they induced me into a coma and intubated me, i had cuts and bruises all over me and my collarbone shattered along with severe hypothermia that felt like it lasted for days. they released me in the early morning, i made up some excuse along the lines of “i was drinking with my friends and they left me, i got drunk and went swimming” then they believed me when i said i guess the waves pulled me out. 

all i needed in those last 5 minutes was a comforting voice. 
i just needed someone to tell me i was going to be okay

"i told my best friend i stopped cutting. and, for the most part, i did. but tonight... i'm sitting next to a sharpened paper clip and i've been scratching at my wrist for so long it's bleeding.this is gonna be long. sorry. 

okay, first off, i've used this forum once before. i was feeling suicidal and i almost tried to kill myself too many times to count. but then, (after begging my parents for months) i went to a psychologist. i talked some things out and got started on medication.  i was feeling good for the first time in a really freaking long time. i felt like i had a chance at getting out of this rut. 

but there was one thing still bothering me. there was this girl that i really, really liked and i never told her. she was a year ahead of me, so now's she at a new school. but i had her number and i told her how i felt. here's the catch: i'm also a girl. she never got back to me, but i was okay with that. i figured at least i gave it a shot. but this experience gave me the courage to speak up about being bisexual. 

i told my mom this morning (after a lot of freaking out). she was super nice and understanding. she assured me she loved me no matter what and that she would accept me no matter what. but as the day went on, she got more and more distant. she told me not to mention it to my cousins or even my dad (which i agreed to). then, she told me not to tell my friends (too late, but i didn't say that). i was trying to understand where she coming from. i mean, i know it's probably a lot to take in. 

then, at about 11 o'clock at night, she came into my room and told me not to ""start shouting this from the rooftops"" because ""i always tried to be accepting of everything you wanted to do, but i don't know if i can accept this"". 
i love my mom more than anything, even though she freaks out a lot. i know she went through a lot as a kid and i'm trying so hard to understand and support her, but then she does shit like this and it hurts. and the stupidest part is, i still want her support more than anything else in this world. 
i had finally learned to accept myself after years of pushing thoughts of girls to the very back of my mind. now, when i think about being bi, i want to vomit. i feel disgusted, i feel disgusting. i feel like crying, but i cried so much before that now the tears won't even come out. 

a few months ago, i promised my best friend that i would stop cutting. he was mildly homophobic, but when i told him, he immediately accepted me and now we talk about girls like it's no big deal. he's like a brother to me and when he begged me to stop cutting, i tried to stop. i've only done it a handful of times since then (before, i was doing it every day). the last time was at least two weeks ago. 

now, i'm bleeding. i'm not suicidal, so maybe this wasn't the right forum, but i feel like i could slip back into that place if something else like happens. 

i know, it's pathetic. one bad day and suddenly i'm falling to shit. i don't know how to explain it. i don't even know if you can understand if you haven't been there before. i just don't wanna do this shit anymore. i don't want to die right now, i just want to stop. stop breathing. stop blinking. stop caring. stop existing. existing hurts. maybe if it all just fades to black, my pulse will slow down and the blood will stop feeding my brain all this shit and i'll be okay again.

"directionless, hurt and unsure anymoreso im a 19 soon to be 20 male studying law atm. my room is a mess,  i have no direction, my gramps is constantly berating me and make me feel like a piece of sht just because i am forgetful and how i'll never be a lawyer at this rate (i lost my keys several times already and my phone before). sometimes, salesman would go through our front gate to reach our home door and knock. this made my gramps paranoid and tells me to lock the front gate everytime i come home. sometimes, i forget and he yells at me and with strong words reminds me of the importance of locking the gate and safety. my little sis also lives 2 min walk away from the school and gramps would tell me to take her to school. today, she just went by herself and me thinking it would be alright, since i had to walk 20mins to school everyday without supervision when i was young, 2 mins without walking with anyone would be alright with her. after finding this out, i tell him 'its only 2 mins away', he replies 'do you know what happened in the news, children get abducted under on min' and then make hurtful statements like ""you think your smarter than everyone else ... you think i don't know that it takes 2 mins!""everyday, he makes me go look for my keys, when i really dont know where i lost them. truth is, he was the one who recommended studying law. while i'm getting excellent grades and have competed in numerous competition, because of what he says i begin to question whether i studied law to make him happy or it was a practical career choice i made on my own. i cry by myself thinking about why i have such a shitty memory struggling to remember where my keys were and it may seem silly but im not sure if i wanna continue anymore. i wouldn't go through enough trouble to commit suicide, but honestly if there was a loaded gun in front of me i would not think twice about it. on top of this, i have 2 moot competitions coming up that require a ton of time to prepare (those who do law know this), and its due in a few days time. i dont wanna let my team member down by not pulling up my load of work, but im questioning whether this career choice is right for me anymore. i studied really hard in high school to get to where i am, and gramps was really proud and bragged to everyone about it - then pushed me to do law. now, i feel he's turning his back on me, saying how just because i did well in high school does not mean i will do well in the future, and strongly asking me how i was going to support my single mothers 300k mortgage. i'm trying really hard to stay on top of my grades, and this requires time on the computer and with books but he keeps disapprovingly saying i should help out the house more, do some housekeeping and reminding me that ""it is your house"" and to stop going on the computer too much. i feel like in his presence, im always depressed, not living up to expectations and i just cry not knowing what to do about it. he reminds me his intentions are well and asks ""do you want me to stop caring for you? if so, then say so and ill leave"" which i know will damage our family relationship and keeps stressing he just wants us to live a better life. despite this, im really having trouble continuing on without some sort of support or pointer that assures me im going the right way. thought this would be a good way to let some steam out, ive been crying all morning.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i think i have a good reason to end myselftrigger warning: suicide

this is a throw away account, as i'm usually not one to post things like this publicly.

i guess i'll give you the lay-down of my situation: 

a year ago, after a depressive break down at a dead end job left me hospitalized and unemployed, i've decided to move back to my home town in order be certified to build websites. my reasoning was that if i could gain a skill that would be valuable to today's market, in addition to my current bfa, i could potentially give myself a chance to be more employable and financially independent. i signed up with a community college (because for-profit schools are predatory), set up healthy boundaries between me and my family, and felt like i was making a positive change for the future. it seemed like things we're looking up. 

cut to now, and i am a 26 year-old dead beat who lives out of his grandmother's basement, has to rely on his father for financial support, who's only job prospect is an ""internship"" at a graphic design studio, and who lacks personal discipline/self-organization/planning skills what so ever.

before i talk about anything else, i will state that i am fully aware that i am the cause of my own misfortune, and as a result, my family have to suffer for my actions. every time i mess up (scratched my grandmother's car at a garage, get sunblock stains on my mother's furniture, etc.), i go through an emotional break where i end up hating myself for a few days, finally let go, and then proceed to forget everything i should have learned from my own mistakes. not only that, but i am inconsiderate of other people's feelings, often side-tracked by work that stops me from focusing on other work, and lack the ambition and discipline to actually make actual lasting change in my life.

i am not here to present myself as some ""tragic"" victim of a cruel world. instead i am going to be truthful: i'm just some asshole who never learns. i live an otherwise privileged life and have a family who, despite screwing them over repetitively, loves me very much. on all accounts, i'm lucky; other people have it worse. what i realize is that i'm parasitic, i take and never give back, and whenever i try to change this about myself, i just go back to square one. the funny thing about rock bottom is that it's not a one time thing that people hit and progress from their; it's a constant loop of repetitive failure, an inability to learn from past actions and a unwillingness to change bad habits.

at this point, i realized that the only good thing i may contribute to society, as well as my family, would be for me to end myself. ideally, i would like to go to somewhere beautiful (a national/state park), find an isolated high place, and then jump towards my death and become carrion to whatever finds my remains. i would like to leave a note for my family, sating why i chose to die and instructing them to cremate my remains (if found) and to not hold a funeral. i don't want to be remembered for anything.

this might be a post where i might just ignore it for the next couple of weeks, or i might actually take initiative in my life for once and end things once and for all. all i know is that i want to make sure i don't leave a impact that would significantly harm someone. i understand that killing myself would be detrimental to my family's emotional wellbeing, but in the long run, they would be in a better place not having to worry or take care of someone like me. the only reason i am making this public is mostly trying to find a place to vent. part of me wants me to think this plan is all wrong, and that i only want verification that i still ""matter"". also, i feel that telling my therapist the true extent of my plans would land me back into a psychiatric ward, and thus burdening my myself with medical debt.

this has been an issue that i have been dealing with for years now. i guess now i understand that disappearing into the woods would be a better alternative then living the parasitic lifestyle i have now.

tldr: i am a human parasite who is unable to learn from past mistakes and realize that this is harming everyone i love. going into the woods to die is a better alternative that putting other people through hell.",suicide,suicide,1.0

""hi mark! i wanted to let you know something that i hope will make your day.
recently, i've been struggling. i've considered killing myself, and harming myself. a lot. i haven't attempted anything. i've come close, but never have, and i now never will. because i just watched your video ""lost a friend"", regarding daniel.

i have never seen any of your videos, but the static that speaks my name and lost a friend are the first 2 videos of yours i've ever watched! and at a time where i am thinking about doing such things. but your message at the end after you finished the game and, i must say, particularly your attempt at telling people about daniel, have helped me. because having seen clips of you at your peaks, seeing you sing about space being cool and all, i thought ""this guy is so happy!""

but then i seen you try and talk but fail as your voice cracked and dissipated. and i realised, after seeing that, that even someone as strong and joyful as you could be broken by the suicide of a close friend.

so no. i'm not going to attempt it. because i can't, i just fucking can't put my friends through that. i can't bear the thought of my friends trying to tell someone about it and being unable to. i can't bear the thought of not being able to help my friends because i'm not here. i'm sitting here crying my eyes out as i type this, but i have to tell you, or it will eat me up inside.

markiplier, you saved my life. you weren't the only person to have done so, but you were one of them. a link in the chain that pulled me out of the pits of despair long enough to see that i can't let myself slip. so, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. if you want to, feel free to share this message with people. maybe other people like me will show up.

"i can’t go back to school after spring break...like everyplace in america, my college is going to take the retarded reactive approach to the coronavirus and wait for a student to instead of proactively closing it. the school is around several elderly communities and nursing homes and hundreds will die when it spreads into the community.

the school is international, kids are traveling everywhere right now. the school banned travel to an anemic list of countries, completely ignoring places the have hundreds of cases and that will have thousands next week.

it’s not a question of if someone brings it back. it. will. happen. i’m sick of complete disregard institutions have about this disease. just because your demographic of people (young and healthy) will have minimal loss, doesn’t mean the more vulnerable won’t.

proactive gets you prepared hospitals and a readied populous. reactive gets you a nursing home full of dead people.

this day 3 months ago i tried to kill myself by overdosing and woke up the next day. i have spent 3 months dragging myself out of madness and depression to get my life back together. i’m home hours away from school on spring break right now. i’m around the few things i give a shit about. my family, my pets, my home and my hobbies. i have a few acquaintances at school, but no friendships. besides getting my degree, i’m more or less incapable of giving a shit about anything at school.

i know my school is going to make the wrong choice. it’s the classic “at least it’s not me” situation with a disease that kills less than 0.1% of young adults, but 10% of the elderly. i don’t want to lose my scholarships and grades, but i refuse to go back until this damned virus is gone.

i don’t want to be in a city filled with the elderly and infirm during a pandemic. i don’t want to be quarantined in some kind of structure surrounded by the sick. i don’t want to be isolated from my family. i don’t want to watch this shitshow unfold in a place with nothing i care about and nothing to live for.

at least at home i will have the strength to move forward and get through this. i know myself and how i work. i have autism, loneliness eats my soul, stress, despair, meaninglessness and hopelessness drives suicidal thoughts. a sustained situation like that will push me off the deep end and will kill me unlike this virus. i’ve been through natural disasters before, a support system like my family is what keeps you going through it. i have nothing for me at college, i merely am a collection of organic matter when i’m there. if i’m forced to go back and i’m right about what is to come, let’s just say there are better things to overdose on...",suicide,suicide,1.0

"killing at least one mosquito every day, except each day i do it differently: day #5 
today at about 6pm (est) i went outside in my front lawn with a plastic ziploc bag. i waited for no more than maybe 10 minutes before spotting a fairly large mosquito hovering around one of the lamps lining the walkway to my house. like anybody else in the situation my first reaction was disgust at having to go within 10ft of such a vile creature. but i completed my mission successfully. it wasn’t too hard to catch the mosquito with the bag and i quickly zipped it up. i then opened the zipper a tiny bit on the opposite side of the bag that the mosquito was on and i squeezed out as much air as possible without crushing or letting the mosquito out. then i resealed the bag and brought up to my room.
fast forward to about 9:30pm (est). i had come back to my room to check on the mosquito. and sure enough, the bugger had died of asphyxiation!

alright guys, this is how i killed a mosquito today, let me know if you like the detailed story style or the straight to the point “this afternoon i stepped on a  mosquito” style

"i'm so lonely. i feel like i have no one.i shouldn't feel that way though. yes, i may have broken up with my fiance about a month ago...but it was for good reason. he began getting abusive again. i stood up for myself the first time. i had promised him when he got back together with me that if he had ever laid a hand on me again, i'd leave. he did good for nine months, and we just so happened to drink for the first time and it all went to complete shit. i should feel happy for sticking up for myself. i should feel happy for admitting that i deserve better. but what if i don't deserve better? what if he's right, that he really will be the person who loved me the most and i'm just going to be alone for the rest of my life? he was the only person who i liked that actually liked me back for once. i've always gotten rejected or used for sex and just...maybe that's all i'm good for. i'm so fucking disgusting. i'm weak. i'm just a fucking stupid, crazy, fat, ugly bitch who's never going to fucking go anywhere in life. i'm going to die alone. everyone says oh, ""you're going places. you're going to change lives. you're gonna be this. you're gonna be that. i can feel it."" i know i'm not though. i just think the world hates me, and that's why my 10 + attempts haven't worked. or maybe i'm even stupider than i think and i'm too stupid to kill myself. who knows? i dunno, man. i just wanna stay high. i wanna talk to someone though. i don't like being alone. i miss taking care of someone. it made me feel worth it. i'm just so down. i have been attempt free since april 26th, 2016 &amp; self-harm free since january 19th, 2017...i don't wanna mess up again..fuck...",suicide,suicide,1.0
"there's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong beforeit's been a strange couple of weeks. i've found myself thinking quite a lot about my distant past, and have been in such a dysphoric mood that i revisited some of my of 'sulking' music. the title is from an elliott smith song, no name no. 5. i used to feel he had perfectly captured the dysphoria i felt when i first discovered it, but perhaps that was more my doing. it's funny looking back on where i was when i felt at my worst as a kid. it's amazing to think where i could be now if i knew how to cope, how to seek help, if i realized i wasn't trapped.

it's not as bad as you think, i can promise you that. it can get better. sometimes you have to change yourself, sometimes you have to challenge what you think makes you happy or sad. sometimes you have to challenge the feeling that you are not in control. and you have to forgive yourself when you just can't. but there's always hope. always.

i'm not sure i'll make it through what's going on right now. but i might. something could give, maybe before i get there something will change for me that is so far outside of my experience that i couldn't even fathom it in this moment. i have to keep looking.

and you have to keep looking. look for something new, inside or outside of yourself. keep looking for a way to live, to be content, to be a part of something. keep looking for a way in to the places you want to be, keep questioning and challenging the things you think you want. keep looking for hope, for love, for compassion and understanding. we all know so very, very little. we don't know where we might find these things, and we may miss them if we don't believe we'll find them. 

so many of you are painfully young. i've been there, i have. i didn't have this, but a lack of support can be enough of a challenge to do better for yourself. i didn't have people to reach out to for support. i'm so, so glad that you do. things can get better. i wish i could instill in you all what has allowed me to survive through as much as i have. maybe if i could, at your age you could find your way to a happy, fulfilling life sooner than you could imagine.

what i'm saying must sound horribly out of touch to some of you, surely it doesn't apply to *you*. we're all unique in our own way, but at the core of your struggle is something we all face. you may not have the skills you need to deal with it right now, but they could come if you give it time. so please, hold on for a while. please, keep looking for comfort, keep looking for warmth and connection. and remember to pass along whatever you find.

i'm not exactly an old man yet, but the stress of the last five years has taken a toll on my health, and there's less time to find some way back to the life i've been working towards. but even if i'm gone tomorrow, i'll be looking tonight.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i hate being a female and sometimes it makes me want to kill myself.i hate being a female and some of the reasons are biological. i hate having breasts and wish i didn’t have boobs. i hate having periods. i hate having a vagina (outside of masturbation anyways) and uterus. sometimes i wish i were the opposite sex. i wish i had a penis and testicles and i hate how small i am and the sound of my voice and stuff like that. i wish i went through puberty as a male instead of a female.

even being reminded that i’m a female or having people say stuff that remind me that i’m a female makes me uncomfortable at times. i know that i am one, but still.

i have seen people on reddit make statements on how women experience things in life or how they feel about something “women are x”, “women think y”, or “women experience z” like for example i have heard people say that women aren’t visual when it comes to sexuality/only into sex for emotional connections rather than to just get off/have low sex drives or that women get along better with men than other women or that women easily get attention on social media and all women have someone that cares about how they feel and will support their feelings and it frustrates me as i feel this is not (always) true.

this may be true for some women and maybe even statistically true for more women than men, but it seems like a generalization in my opinion and is personally not true for me from my personal experience. obviously, people can generalize men’s experiences in some ways too or make generalizations on what men think, but this is just a rant.

there’s also the feeling of feeling like i’m inferior. females are physically weaker than men and i heard that even mentally that they are worse off since statistically they have lower spatial ability on average and worse logical reasoning on average and are less likely to be geniuses on iq tests. i also heard that they have lower reaction times. as someone who likes video games, having a weaker spatial ability and reaction time can be a disadvantage and it sucks knowing that i will probably suck at competitions over this. as someone interested in math and sciences, having a weaker spatial ability and logical reasoning can be a disadvantage and as a stem major, sometimes i wonder if i’ll never be good enough.

biologically and mentally, there don’t seem to be any advantages of being a female. well, i heard that women are better with communication/language skills and social skills, but i seem to suck at that, so it seems that i can’t do anything right (i’m really awkward at speaking and talk very slowly and awkwardly. trying to express thoughts into words can be hard at times. sometimes i forget the meaning of words really easily and look up things in the dictionary a lot to reassure myself whether i know the meaning. i have weak social skills and it’s hard for me to talk/interact with people and as a result, i became a loner and a hermit with no friends.). sometimes i feel like i will never achieve anything that interests me in a significant way or be the best at anything and that my biology will always be a barrier.

there are other biological things that make me jealous about the opposite sex too, like how men can achieve orgasms easier and have more places for sexual pleasure (they have a dick and a prostate) while females seem to only have the clitoris. i wonder if sex feels better for a male than a female.

what sucks about being physically and mentally uncomfortable is that i can’t really change these things. they are permanent. i’m stuck with my body and mental state forever.

it is true the grass is not always greener on the other side. i have heard of the term “female privilege”, but they are societal rather than biological and not based on immutable traits relating to the feeling of biological inferiority. some examples i have heard are: lower suicide risk in most countries, lower workplace accidents, getting better grades in school, easier to get laid, alimony, easier time seeking child custody, lower prison sentences on average, can express emotions more openly, can marry up, more reproductive freedom, can be trusted more around children, etc. i found out about these kinds of stuff on certain subreddits and websites.

i probably won’t use some of these privileges since i never plan on having children, getting married/a relationship, having sex, or even making friends and would probably live an isolated life due to social anxiety, but there are some privileges that may still apply. to be honest, i would rather be oppressed in society than to feel uncomfortable in my own skin, my own sense of self, and the perceptions of myself though (i know it sounds dumb knowing that i may be worse off this way, but it’s just how i feel.) also, knowing that there are privileges with being female make me feel guilty about my gender to be honest and it feels like i am the more “evil” gender for having the upper hand in some ways sometimes. well, being a female can come with social downsides too and which one is worse is subjective i guess.

my gender has started bothering me since i have hit puberty (started growing breasts at 8?9? and having periods at 10), but even though its been over a decade now (i'm almost 21), i still have regrets over my existence. it has gotten worse over time and learning about the social differences between men and women when i got older only made me feel worse. finding out that there are more differences between male and female besides physical stuff made me feel worse. ever since hitting puberty, i started to feel more depressed and started expericing suicidal thoughts and i wonder if it’s a hormonal thing for all women who hit puberty.

i’m not transgender, like i didn’t show signs of gender non conformity as a kid and don’t know what it means to feel like a man or feel like a woman or anything like that, but i still struggle to cope with these things and sometimes i feel like killing myself for being a female. i don’t normally rant or like sharing my personal issues very often, but here i am getting this off my chest.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm a stranger to myselfi know that this will probably go unread because of it's length.. it is basically my life story.

when i was in first grade my parents divorced. i had no clue why i wasn't seeing them in the same places anymore, and i was completely in the dark about what the hell was going on. so over the course of that year i internalized all the issues and convinced myself that it was all my fault that they couldn't be together around me. this is important. i thought that they just weren't together around me. i thought it was just something that parents do. i rationalized that they took turns working while the other parent was with me.

so then about mid way through second grade someone finally told me that my parents had gotten divorced and it was like night and day. life just shut the fuck off right then as it all sunk in. i beat myself up over and over about how it was my fault and that i could have dome something to save their relationship. i was a smart kid, and i was very keen at drawing the relationships between things and what came of it. so in way i came to the conclusion that because the union that had brought me into existence was split, that i was inherently an outlier. and when i say that i mean in the sense that i didn't quite belong. i felt unwanted and began to seclude myself in my own head. which ended up making me a much smarter person in general, but it comes back to bite later in life. 

the isolation that resulted from my seclusion became chronic. it skewed what people saw as my personality from an outgoing friendly person, into a quiet, secluded and contempt individual. that felt great for a long time too. i'm inherently suggestible, so if i am being told something over and over again i will end up believing it. in this case i thought that i was something that i wasn't. 

then in middle school is when the discrepancy started to take it's toll. as i started thinking more and more about myself and why i didn't seem to fit in anywhere or why no one really wanted to be friends with me, i ended up getting a tad self destructive. i went through a little mini suicidal stint, but i didn't really grasp the concept of suicide itself so it was mostly harmless. but i really solidified my depression in this time. also i developed crippling social anxiety. to this day i cannot show myself to people when i interact with them. thus i formed the ""mask"" that so many like minded people develop. to anyone unfamiliar with that term, an emotional mask is a covering to a powerful and visceral set of emotions that you interact through almost like a second face. 

i was conscious about my decision to live life with a mask on. another big mistake that is coming back to haunt me currently. 

long story short, in seventh grade i was infatuated by this girl named kaitlyn and she kept dating all my friends and that made my life pitiful for a while. then in 8th grade i joined the school dance team and found my healthy escape. i made my only true friend in the world and we won 2 major national dance competitions in one year. 
once i had sufficiently come to terms with life, in fact as my demons and i were signing the peace agreement and i got sent to a private all guys catholic school. 
freshman year i wanted to die. but i was too afraid to do it. every night i foolishly prayed to a deaf god that all my sufferings could just end in a dissociating wave of oblivion. i went through every day hoping that some freak accident would end me so i wouldn't have to. then, i had to start trying really fucking hard in biology just to stay in school. i failed the first semester with a 40 something and the councillor told me i needed a 90 to not be expelled. my parents made my life a living hell (they thought i was fine at this time) and every fucking second was spent doing some bullshit that my biology teacher only assigned me to ""catch up"" (that crusty hag just hated me). i made it through the year, barely passing, so sophomore year i had her again for chemistry so i decided to freak her out by trying in class. in the process i reignited a passion for science that almost made me smile sometimes. and of course, the devil himself decided to pop into my life in the form of a girl names grace.

so now we get to why i am really fucked. 

i gave her every little bit of my being while we dated. she was the only person i came out of my shell for. she was worth living for. i was happy for the first time in 10 years and it felt amazing. but that ended and she did it like a coward. over text, the day before valentines day. i secluded myself more thoroughly than i ever had before. i didn't speak to anyone for 4 days. i just laid in bed and cried. i rapidly became actively suicidal again as my mental state deteriorated (i tried to kill myself once before, when i was still with grace) then i tried again. 36mg xanax (this is actually ridiculous in itself. this alone should have killed me), handle of everclear and 30mg of adderall to try to speedball. but somehow i didn't die. 

so come today, the ""mask"" is it's own person. i feel like i died that night. like i shouldn't be here right now typing this. i'm a spectator to my own actions. i'm developing dissociative personality disorder i've been told. it actually makes sense in retrospect. people treated me like someone i'm not and i went along with it. i fucked myself. i don't know what to do, the world seems to be crashing in from all sides, i've never felt so alone. i just want everything to be over with.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i don't feel like i can get help, anyway. i don't know if it's irrational or not, but i honestly feel that asking for help and all that comes with that would end up being more of a monetary and mental burden on everyone else (and myself, obviously) than just dying. i used to think i would live longer and get help without bothering anyone with it, but as time has gone on i'm realizing that that's not really possible. i seem to get worse and worse very quickly. never bad enough to stop pretending i'm good though. guess i'm lucky in that respect?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"this isn’t much of a rant but i am so damn happy lmao a few months ago (before covid) my mom went to court with my dad to gain custody over me &amp; my sister. i don’t wanna have a long ass paragraph but to make it short she got custody after fighting for 7+ years (it was split custody before) but i’m just so relived to be able to stay in a home i feel safe in &amp; happy in. 
 
my dad never physically abused me or my 2 sisters (the oldest is 19 and not relevant to the story since she’s an adult &amp; lives alone so like-) anyways, he never physically hurt us but made me &amp; my sisters emotionally hurt &amp; none of us remember much from our childhood since we suppressed most of the memories. 

but as i said i’ve been living with my mom now for around 3 months and i haven’t really talked much about it to anyone except for close friends from my old school. i’ve been settling in and trying to get into a better state of mind and yeah...it’s going really good.

"i'm desperate need of advice. you lot seem perfect.x-post from /r/advice: can this breach of trust lead to a net good? this is some real shit that i need a couple anonymous minds to help me out on.

hi, all. first time poster - using my depression redditting alt. 

so. wall of text. but this means a lot to me, and i could seriously use some advice. tl;dr at bottom, but the context is important.

i am visiting my home province from living near my uni, staying a week with my family. we're all incredibly close, in a way that we all overtly recognize as special, and atypical. we love each other through thick and thin, and can spend hours at a time laughing with each other over food we've all helped prepare. we operate under the assumption that there are no secrets and every facet of our lives are able to be safely shared and enjoyed, with nothing more than guidance or well-meant words to direct our actions. we have all found this to be comfortable, flexible, and allowing for us each to find our own happiness, sociability, and success.

today, after dinner, and while my 3 siblings (all younger) were away with their respective pals' houses, i walked into my sister's art room. it's my old room, which she uses to paint, sketch, store her instruments, etc... 

it's incredible. art everywhere, genuinely, objectively good art, portraits and landscapes of a quality that i would never hope to accomplish. there are small books of sketches laying open on the dresser, half-finished paintings on easels, sticky notes of ideas, and supplies that are somehow both organized and yet sprawling throughout the room. i take a few minutes to get really close to some of these paintings, appreciating the massive amount of time and effort that went into them - looking at how she's used highlighting techniques so sparingly yet accurately, how she's used grid systems for portrait copying, and things like that. there are pieces everywhere. and there is a leather notebook with a sketching pencil inside laying out on her desk.

i open it, expecting to be greeted with more of her wonderful art, but i find a date, a title, and text. 

it's her diary.

i broke our trust entirely. i read it front to back. i felt pretty awful during that time, and you are all free to chastize me for doing the one thing a girl would never want their brother to do, and what i should never do, but the more i read, the more i needed to read. 

the contents terrified me. she is horribly depressed. 

i've been dealing with bipolar 2 disorder my whole life. i'm familiar with her feelings. i sought the help of my family, medication, therapists, psychiatrists, and friends. but it was hard. and took years to begin. since then, my family have been nothing but supportive.

the entries started out this year, and simply with inspirational quotes, goals, plans, sketches, song lyrics, but now what she is telling her diary is pretty much what i tell myself when i'm in need of seeing a therapist. she speaks of death, life's purpose (or lack thereof), loneliness, the idea of happiness, and pain more than anything else. her friends treat her like garbage, use her, mock her, embarrass her in truly awful ways, and then lie to my family about it all, to apparent success. she talks about the expectations people hold her to, her lack of interest in everything, and how lonely she will be once the sibling older than her leaves (in 2 weeks).

she has been taken the rough route with her dating life as well. sadly, i mean that in the worst of ways. she is a victim of sexual assault. my first reaction was to literally ball up my fist and shake in rage. i've met this person. i've smiled and shook his hand. i immediately began envisioning myself breaking his nose when he answers me at his door. 

it sounded horrific and devastating. the entries got worse after that. she speaks frequently of death and hatred. most of her entries were about how alone she feels. this all broke my heart. she's no longer addressing her entries to her diary, but to whoever finds it when she's gone. she's now been cutting in places where people won't see it.

i have struggled with suicidal ideation and cutting personally. i kept it hidden. very well hidden. i'm scared that she has the same ability. this terrifies me, because i finished my would-be suicide note the same month i was elected student body president - and she seems super happy and successful like i was. 

i need help with this. i can't go immediately to anyone she or i knows yet because i don't want to fuck this up. this happened tonight, and she's away, so there is time to react with you all. here are my questions;

is this a problem i should be seeking to solve? i know that is a very strange proposition to make, but diaries can often be an exersize of one's darkest (and potentially exaggerated) feelings. she could be ok and using it as a release - but should i react as i want to?

how do i approach her about therapy and medication? should i mention my own experience and struggle? or just open a conversation? my family is lovely, but she is obviously hesitant to seek their help, as i was. she had an entry about her friends not listening to her pleas for help. she has pages of ""help me"" scratched hard into the paper. i want to try.

do i tell her i read it? is there any path to lessen the blow? i know i'm an asshole for doing so, but now i feel that i may be trying to save her life. i think i need to act fast. 

anything will help. i love her. i don't want to know she's in this pain and carrying trauma without acting on it. but this is a teetering situation and i need to be careful.

i am sharing too much information - i know. but she will not see this, and i will delete it within a small amount of time. but please, while you can; help.

tl;dr i read a book, which ended up being my sister's diary, and now know for a fact that she has been assaulted and is depressed, cutting, and suicidal. i breached trust, but now have some crucial information. what do i do?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"suicide, and it's cowardice. or is it?much like the rest of the world, i live with the thoughts of suicide, day in and out. i hear on a regular basis (local folk, not on the internet), that suicide is a coward's method, that it is 'taking the easy way out' instead of solving the problem.

still, i'd rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive, and quite frankly, creepy behaviour that i can't seem to be rid of.

i've driven all my friends away, save the select few i've known for years. i've distanced myself from family, and i live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that i can't let go of until i'm forgiven by whom i'd hurt. 

suicide, and for that matter, any death, is not 'the easy way out', because it's enduring one final pain to make the rest stop. those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness, we embrace it. while it brings sorrow to our families, they get over it, just like the rest of the problems they face.

we're remembered for the positives, not for the negatives. and, i think that counts for something. it's not cowardice that drives is to that point. it's one final breath of courage.

much like many other members of my family, i'm sure that one day i will join the great darkness. fit now though, i have my obsession to keep me alive, and people i must care for.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i’m giving up. unfinished but here’s where i’m ati can’t do anything right.
i’m just a sad sack of shit. 
anytime i let my walls down and care for someone, they leave. it’s happened countless times and i’ve just come to realize that i’m completely worthless.
nobody will ever care, i’m a burden to my family, and i really don’t seem to have any friends. i won’t be missed and i’ve accepted that. i don’t know how i’m going to go about it, all i know is that for the last ten years i’ve been hoping for death. i need to take the initiative and get what i want. because nobody cares, not really, not past the surface level that i show. deep down, i’m nothing. deep down, i don’t deserve to be happy. obviously, since any time i think i’m happy, everything starts crashing down around me. i hope someone notices me missing, if only so my pets will have someone to care for them. 
i make others feel like a burden, when, at the end of the day, it’s me. i’m the burden in everyone’s lives, even if they don’t really realize it. 
i just want this guilt to end. i feel so heavy, i feel so helpless. i don’t know how much longer i can hold on and keep fighting. is there even a point anymore? i don’t think there is.
i have absolutely nothing to live for at this point. i can’t do anything, i don’t know if i want to do anything. i just want it all to end. i just. i can’t. the supposed fight isn’t worth it. i’ve already checked out. i just need to figure out how to fix this. how to end it all. i’m scared, yeah. but in the end, it’s better off for everyone i’ve ever come into contact with if i just were to stop existing. 
if this hurts anyone, i’m sorry. it’ll pass quickly, because you’ll realize that all i’ve said is true. i am a burden. i am useless. i am hopeless. i am helpless. i am worthless. this is what’s best for everyone. it’s not my intention to hurt anyone, but i guess i have a history of doing just that without even trying, so i guess in death i’ll be no different. 
i have nothing left to lose. 
i had happiness, or at least a glimpse of it. but as always, i somehow managed to sabotage it. i thought i had found someone who would love me and understand me. but of course i drove them away. i didn’t mean to, i never meant to push you away. i loved you with all of my heart and all of my being. i never ever wanted to hurt you, and even in trying my best not to, i always did. and for that, for hurting someone so amazing, i deserve this. i deserve to be miserable. 
but i don’t think i’m strong enough to live with being this miserable. i love you, and in death, i know i will always love you. you’ll always be ‘the one,’ as cliche as that is. i knew i would spend the rest of my life with you, and i suppose i did. or i at least came close. i’m sorry for making you feel like you weren’t enough, you were never the problem. it’s always been inside of me, somehow projecting itself onto you.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"the thing is, i just don't matter to anyone.disclaimer: this may be a lot of rambling but i need someone to hear me.

i'm not actively suicidal. i just think about it frequently. 
i've always been someone who didn't have a ton of friends. even in high school, i didn't have any girl friends. i had two boyfriends, and at the time i was with them, they were my best and only friends. i've had acquaintances, and i seem to get along with almost everyone, but no one ever wants to be close with me. i never have a problem when it comes to finding a significant other, but no one ever wants to be my friend. no one ever seems to want to spend time with me. for awhile, i reached out to people who i seemed to have a connection with. i don't anymore. i text them, they blow me off; it's happened so many times that i can't even handle the rejection anymore.

everyone has family who cares about them, you might think? my mother cut ties with me when i was 18. she heard somehow that i had started smoking cigarettes and told me that 'if i'm going to kill myself then she's not going to watch me do it'. that was 10 years ago. 

i was always close with my dad and my stepmother. a few months ago, i decided that i wasn't happy being away from my exboyfriend, and i left the guy i was with to get back together with him. this did not please my father, to say the least. i got a nasty text message that said i needed to return his car, which i was borrowing. he said he didn't mind me borrowing it, but he wouldn't want anything to do with me if i was getting back together with said ex (let's call him george). 

i'm a very stubborn individual by fault. i can't stand for anyone to tell me what to do, and at 28, it's the worst it's ever been. i was supposed to move in with my father and his girlfriend, but i moved in with george instead, due to the events that occurred. i haven't spoken with them since. my stepmother tried to reach out to me, but all she did was tell me about family events i was missing, and all the reasons my father is mad at me. this of course, angered me more than anything. i've already felt abandoned, i feel like he should love me in spite of anything, and be there for me no matter what. we've been close for a long time. i know plenty of people who have betrayed their parents trust, and their parents still love them. i've never done anything (stolen, lied, etc.) and he just cast me aside. that hurt me.

i'm a very free spirited person, and i don't believe you should necessarily try to maintain a relationship that is unnatural or forced. but i never thought my dad would treat me this way. 

george loves me, but since he's all i have, i seem to put this stress on him that's unhealthy for our relationship. so that's going down the drain now too.

and i don't have a single friend or family member that i have an actual closeness to.

so, i'm not going to kill myself tonight. i'm just starting to wonder, why i don't? why am i even here? i seem to only negatively impact the people i am close with. most people won't even get that close. i have a ton of flaws, but i have a ton of love. i can't stand to see anyone hurting, human or animal. that's why i became a vegan, because i saw too many documentaries. it just hurt so much to even watch them. 

i know i'm not like most other people.
i just need someone to tell me that i'm not completely worthless. i can't understand why no one really wants me around, and i'm drowning in all these thoughts i have when i'm alone.

i don't get any of the informal signals nothing. i just wing it, and come across as creepy and desperate. i used to think it was me being fat and ugly holding me back. i have lost over 40 pounds from 200 to 150s and have muscle and am in great shape. 

also to mention i'm a brown dude in a white city but even the brown girls seem to spurn my looks and advances. i have no friends, the only person i talk to regularly apart from fake interactions with coworkers is my brother.

i am beggining to feel like the rheseus monkeys that are socially dysfunctional from harlow's experiments. i act on the wrong cues, based on the fact that i already have a stereotypical disadvantage to begin with being a different color, then add to that social ackwardness and its a recipe for disaster. just like the monkeys i fight when i shouldn't, i approach when i should act indifferent, and these are picked up by people and i get socially excluded. then begins a vicious cycle where this long term loneliness creates further stress and inconfidence and makes the small chance of getting somewhere seem all the more unlikely.

at this point the suffering that i feel is genuine and real. i feel a natural urge to connect with people and to try to meet women. however instead of a simple no or lack of interest, most people begin to dislike me as they take my social ackwardness as a sign of malice.

"today i got a surprise gift in the mail from my boyfriend in long-distance! awww! today i am super happy because my boyfriend, who i have a long distance relationship with, sent me a surprise gift! i can't really talk to my friends about this because they don't know him that much and a few refuse to talk to him since he is dating me. :( so, here i am on reddit.

he sent a few things, i won't name them all. a few items were socks, a dog plush, a ton of pusheen stickers which each had their own individual note, and a letter. he also sent me the only pride gear i own (he is trans, i am female)!

i feel really happy. he is so kind! :)

i hope that everyone else here finds someone they can have a nice relationship with! relationships come pretty randomly, but being a part of society helps a lot. i am introverted myself and connected with him thorough similar interests and discord, so that's a great way to find nice people!

i wish i could do something in return, but it costs an insane amount of money to ship to his country (as he said, ""it costs as much as starbucks"" to send stuff to me) and only documents are allowed. it is a post-ussr country and this mail system totally shows it. i decided that i will just do nice things for him on minecraft! i've made him a few skins and a parrot-room, so i will do more things like that!

oh, now i realize that he might be trying to repay me since i got him minecraft as a gift a few weeks ago. he said that he was planning on sending me this in december, but his schoolwork has been harsh since. i guess minecraft prompted this. awww, this is so nice!

"feel terrible about past mistakesthere have been a few occasions where i was out at a club and dancing with a girl where i took things too far. basically on a few separate occasions while extremely intoxicated and dancing with a girl i have fingered my way through clothing and touched a breast for a couple of seconds. the first couple times i did it the girl i was dancing with seemed to have no problem with it, even kissing/making out with me. to me this made it seem to like somehow this was okay. i now realize i was terribly wrong and there is no excuse for my actions. i have no idea what possessed me to make me think this was okay. the most recent time i did this which was about a year and a half to two years ago  i may have accidentally exposed the girl i was dancing with. although she kissed me as well i feel i made her uncomfortable with what i did and my presence in general which hurts me the most because i genuinely care about people and the last thing i want to do is hurt anyone. her friend escorted her out of the club and yelled at me. i immediately realized that what i had done was wrong. i wish i had never done any of this. i feel like the biggest scum on the face of the earth. i’ve tried to forgive myself for my actions but don’t feel i deserve forgiveness.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

i am almost certain that i will be convicted. it is highly unlikely that i'll show up. dying is my end game. either i die this week or i die as as a fugitive. i don't intend to risk having the trouble of trying to die while in prison. 

last time i tried was emotional. this time will be logical, and it is much harder to make the decision without strong emotions. but i recall the peace i felt after realizing i will actually die only to wake up to the disappointment that i will not. 

last time, the pills and the water made me vomit too soon. i threw up 4 hours after i took them. i am afraid something similar will happen this time, and then i will not have enough to try again since i am unwilling to order anymore or wait that long. if that happens, i will have to try alternatives and the thought of any of them makes me sick. i am not violent by nature. i don't want to die violently. 

i have no reason to live and stand trial. any career i had in computer science is mostly over. it will not matter how talented i am, how much experience i have, or where i went to school. no one hires a felon or wants to work for one. and even if i get out, the industry will have changed making my knowledge irrelevant. for sure, i have no future.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i know i sound so petty, but i really just had that long, deep contemplation about life and death. it's just so stupid. living in this stupid fucking world. it's a pay-to-win kinda life. nobody should have to live like this, not being able to afford the things we go to work to be able to afford. it's an oxymoron, i think.

so right now i'm just hoping to spontaneously die. i know it isn't fair to leave bf all alone with his vampire of a dad, but honestly what else is there to life than money? ""oh sweetie at least you have someone who loves you"" yea that's fantastic too bad his dad sucks, literally. 

and it's not like we can just cut him off, cuz he's faaaaamily. it'd be wroooong and he neeeeeeds his only soooon. funny enough he was considering moving far away just because of this, but i still have school so we're stuck here. 

just has me thinking how my family would never let this happen. then i think about how much different his family is than mine. my family are all successful and nurturing while his are either retired or crotchety workers with nearly all living paycheck to paycheck. it's a drastic change for me. i'm used to having everything lain out for me, knowing exactly what to do and what is to come, knowing exactly how much money i'll have and when. now it's like ""uh oh i accidentally missed a such-and-such payment can i borrow $300?"" ...what?? 

i'm losing my damn marbles. i was actually considering cancelling my plane ticket to go home for the holidays just so i can get a part time job and pay for fucking groceries. i know it's not a big deal but for me it'd be a sacrifice, especially since the tickets are already paid for and can't be refunded, but also because my family is really looking forward to seeing me for the first time simce june. 

it's not that i don't have a work ethic or don't want to work, i'm just a full time student and asking for 3 weeks off in the winter is a big no no in some workplaces. as soon as i get back i'll be looking for a job, as i initially intended, but that would have just been for fun and work experience to put on my resume, but now i have to work. 

things were so fine and i was doing so great but now i have $200 to my name and i'm freaking out. 

with only 2 weeks left until my trip, idk how anyone can survive on only $200. who knows if i'll ever seen my 500 again. who knows if bf will ever get to keep some change from his paycheck.

i've been thinking about suicide lately, and this isn't the first time but it's back, thinking about hanging myself again, at least trying. first time didn't go too well, but i know the perfect place, it has hundreds of support beams and railings i could end it on.

sad that the only thing stopping me is someone coming in and fucking around with my body

i would feel no pain, pass out within 3-7 seconds, be gone in 7 minutes, it would save me always fighting for nothing.

there is always the bullshit of ""people care"" but how can people care about someone they don't even know

some nights i'll just cry until i pass out, but luckily i don't cry loud, i can contain the screams and shouts, just feel warm tears rolling down my face as i'll be texting someone as if i'm ok because i know from the times i broke down they got sick of me, they always do...

today i was at the place, where ill leave, and one of my 'friends' came up to me and said i was being rude, i was trying so hard to hold back tears, i couldn't even look her in the eye which probably didnt help. i managed to not have a tear drop but i could feel it... and the thing is i could of broken down, just cried and cried but all that would of happened was them walking off calling me a freak, baby, psycho.

because they don't know every night for me is a battle, they dont know how hard it is every day, they think they do because something didn't go their way, i've tried telling them, i've tried getting help, i've tried so fucking hard to make others happy, i wouldn't care i was suffering, i'm just writing this as i go along, now in tears again hoping no one walks in my room....

what do people want from me... why am i not good enough... people always rather get a new toy rather then fix the old one, i've just been put aside by everyone...



i could go there right now.... i could end it all... no more pain.... no more suffering..... no more lies or hurt, no more bullshit...





it's a bit too dark i guess.... no one would be there for hours and hours... someone would find my body.... doubtful they would call the police... they would just get freaked out and leave... or maybe laugh.... i know people that would pay to see my lifeless body


i could just cut again... i did last month and no one cared, i try hiding them but eventually someone see's, when they do it will be a taunt, some people you can tell see it, then they just stay quiet, people you thought cared, i didnt want them to see it but its not because they didnt want to upset me, its because they didnt wanna deal with me.

fuck people....

i'm going live 1 last week.




1 long week


i will try not to get upset or angry, i will continue my day as normal, i won't text anyone or try and see anyone


see if anyone would text me first, or even want to be around me...





i will continue to update this post every day, for 7 days



i have one week to set my goodbye's not that anyone would care or even read them, i will set delayed messages so no one can call the cops.


they don't care but when it's too late that's when people all the sudden care oh so much.

"how long do these thoughts lastfor the last 2 and a half years it's been nothing but fucking bullshit. sure i can make people laugh, sure i have some friends, but what's the goddamn point? i know these people say shit about me the second i turn around, i know that i'm an ugly bastard that's just going to be alone for a long ass time before i settle with someone who i don't find attractive just so i can say i didn't die alone. 2 and a half years of crying over nothing and wondering when it's going to start getting better. the suicidal thoughts never end, i think about it daily. i can just imagine the bastards tweeting some bullshit like ""another suicide at our school, guess nobody learns"" i can imagine them all saying stuff about how everyone loved me, and no one was rude. that's the only reason i haven't gone through and done it yet, because i think it would be a waste if i didn't get to see how everyone reacts and fronts on some bullshit like how much everyone loved me. i probably end up doing it anyway, just to get away and end the constant worrying about ""oh i wonder if she actually likes me"" ""am i texting her too much"" ""why doesn't he stop being a cock and staring at me like he wants to fight""

anyways, sorry for such a long and rambling post, i just can't really articulate these feelings in the most comprehensive way because i'm crying haha. maybe someone here can give me a reason to not take a toaster to the bathtub.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"the worst part about si..military guy here. long story short, it isn't for me. it's driven me to have frequent suicidal ideation. i've lost a career because if it, but for now i'm still stuck in the military system. 

i wouldn't classify myself as at risk; i simply won't do that to my wife. as bad as things are for me, i can't imagine giving her that grief. 

so the worst part of si, no one believes me. often i feel i want to do it just so people would have taken all the help i've requested seriously. instead, i'm called a malingerer. i'm labeled as one trying to con the system. i'm treated as a criminal for not having the will to deal with job stress anymore. i've given up fighting for what i believe in and getting what i want, aside for a discharge. 

i feel like i'm downing. i feel imprisoned. i haven't been seeing any help for the last six months since the only outcome is more restrictions on the limited freedom i have. as soon as you mention suicide, you're targeted for ""help."" not one of my superiors has wanted to help; they just want to cover their assess in the event something happens. 

so yeah. i'm not in a great place. if anyone wants to chat a bit (military preferred), shoot me a pm. i could use a stranger to vent to. i feel bad telling my wife (who is suffering from depression), and i don't want my few friends to see me like this. hell, i don't want the world to see me like this, but like i said, i refuse to return to military mental health providers.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"feeling more dead than alivejust spent the weekend with my only relatives who really love me, my grandparents, one of whom was just in the hospital with pneumonia for the past month and a half, and the other of whom is in hospice with late-stages alzheimer's.

when they go, i want to die too. i feel like my parents would get over it, my aunt never liked me in the first place, my other aunt is estranged from the family (for which i don't blame her), and my uncle is dead (suicide, about ten years ago). my friends are either shallow dipshits obsessed with money or sex or just themselves, or else they're just too busy to deal with me because they have their own problems. 

i've never had anyone who really loved me, the way an so would, and have instead been raped and abused by the people i tried to love and be loved by.

i am dead inside, a living dead girl. the only thing ""worthwhile"" about me is that i have a ""good"" job, but in the end, who cares about that? i've been depressed for years and have seen more than i ever wanted to from humanity.

"i owe you all an update. i'm changing my course in life and my depression is lifting. i want to live.i was suicidal and highly unstable for 6 to 8 months following an unusual layoff. my position was eliminated just 8 months after leaving my parents' house for the first time and had to move back. that destroyed me because it had taken me a year to find that job, i'd only been there for a year, and i have bipolar type ii. 

life was already hard and then my independence, privacy, money, ability to date, sanity, and friends all slowly disappeared as i wen't insane for a few months. i genuinely wanted to die. it took me a year to give up on my previous career (business analytics and strategy) and chose a new direction. this is daunting but also very exciting. 

i'm extremely stressed out over an exam i need to study for to the point of having trouble eating (type a personality and i test well; its all on me if i fuck this up instead of doing great). my two close friends decided they've had enough of my crazy bullshit, so now i have none. a few months ago that would mean a desperate cry for help on this sub. 

instead, i'm just focusing on trying to see have no friends as an opportunity to expand my horizons and reassess how i treat people. there is a couple at my bdsa group who seem super chill that i always talk with, i should try asking them to chill at some point. i think part of the problem is that i get along better with people who are a little older. 

so yeah, thanks for all the support over the years sw. from when i wanted to die because i was undiagnosed and bipolar five years ago, to what will hopefully be the last suicidal post from me just two months prior to this one. good luck out there and don't forget that things can change. you just have to be relentless and never stop searching for a cocktail of coping mechanisms. if something doesn't work, its okay to be sad, but don't use that as an excuse to give up. be proud of yourself for trying, and keep going. and never keep doing something just because it *should* work and isn't. that's a dead end too. you just have to keep moving forward and keep trying new solutions. one day at a time. one foot in front of the other.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

"how can i motivate myself and choose a career after troubled 5-10 yearsi'm 22 now and i don't know where to start so ill do like a life story thing 

around year 9/10 i started to get depressed in school i couldn't find a topic i liked enough i could see a career and my grades weren't the best which was making me feel worse and more depressed over time. i went through my gcse's without realising and acknowledging i was depressed and after i just made it into sixth form with 5 c grades i was feeling like i was worthless since some subjects didn't accept me but let people with lower grades in. but happy that i made it in in general. it was a strange feeling. 

after this the trend kept continuing with me not getting grades i was happy with and getting more and more distant and depressed. i dropped my favourite subject after feeling id never do well in it and taking the teachers ""if you don't put effort in don't bother handing it in"" too much to heart and not handing in course work because i felt it was never good enough.
this ended up with me taking days off and just staying home depressed and staring at the ceiling. this went to a head in a 6week row of staying off and i went back they made me start the second year again (understandable) 
unfortunately the cycle repeated and near the end i was self harming and suicide attempts. actually realising i must have something wrong mentally, i was put on medication. i wanted to try and ask for help but the teachers had a meeting when i was off and decided to kick me out. this led to a basically a full on mental breakdown which 5 years later i still kind of have. 

after about a 2 years of staying home doing nothing with only my mum and close penpal stopping me from ending it i started to volunteer at a charity shop which has boosted my self esteem a lot and after the shop did a revamp recently i was offered to do a customer service nvq for free from them which is was happy. but knowing my record was terrified of as well. 

it's present day now and i'm actually writing this today because i walked past my old sixth form head, which i haven't seen since i was last in school. 
this gave me what i can describe as flashbacks making me feel just as i did then and mentally knocking my progress back. 
what it made me realise is i need to try and move on. i don't know how, with where i am. or if i even can move on. weather my life is even worth trying to recover since i'm 22 now. is there anyone who has been in my situation and got themselves together?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i feel trapped, no where to escape.i'm from the uk.

i'm a mixture of highly anxious and depressed. i just want to withdraw from everything. i screwed up life and i won't be able to achieve the things i want. i feel heavily screwed. i hate college and it makes everything worse for me, i'm such an idiot for not being able tune in with my emotions and yet i'm suffering because of this.

i heard from my friend that this dude left his sixth form and is now moving to the sixth form college i go to. and so basically there is a free space left and my mate suggested that i should move back. the problem is that i left that college to go to my current one because i felt really dumb there as there a lot of clever students. in which i felt the opposite as well as being secluded and having no one which caused me to impulsively change. but the fact that there is a little glimmer of hope that i can move back to this sixth form makes me really anxious and depressed as my mate said that he will explain everything about my situation to the sixth form (depression and anxiety which caused me to leave the school like this because i felt like no one could really relate to me) to see that they can take me back given that it's within my local area too as the other college which i absolutely dread is in another town and that as well as mentally affecting also affects me physically.

as well as this, biology is the subject that really causes me to be depressed as i don't find any interest in it anymore and use as my career wise it's something different. i wanted to study medicine but im wanting to study maths now as medicine is unbelievably competitive and it's something i know i wouldn't enjoy. i hate my biology teacher and just don't find anything enjoying anymore since i step foot back into this college. ever since i did, i felt even more stupid compared to these other students, it's like this college will somehow end up sabotaging me in terms of my future aspirations and will never be able to look in to my potential.

i'm currently getting support from my counselor by getting cbt and learning the practices of mindfulness. i'm also getting fluoxetene to also help my self and make sure that the support i'm getting will be effective as my initial low mood causes me not to even get out of my house whenever i have free days.

of course, this isn't my main root of depression but one of many as i've more or less experienced this for years but hadn't had help but yet slowly came to become used to it where i don't even bother releasing out my emotions anymore, just can't be bothered.
life outside i really don't do much, i use to do alot of things that i enjoy but i don't get any satisfaction from it anymore. i usually would study alot and go gym but even studying now seems soo much hard work for something that i can't really be bothered about. i just hate going there i just hope that this other sixth form is willing to take me back in as my college allowed this person to enrol in this time of the year in which he came from the sixth form my friend went. i just hope that they will do the same for me if they can see into my situation and realize how much it's deteriorating me as a person.

job, money, location, success, friends, girlfriend, social life, etc. amazing how much that can change in five years, isn't it? 

now i'm nobody. i serve no purpose. i'm getting older, due to a few crippling injuries i can't do much. i've alienated all of my friends through ignorance. i turned to painkillers to survive the day-to-day, but that gave way to alcoholism, which gave way to unemployment and homelessness. 

i'm in my later 30s, living in my mother's guest room, no longer even have a bank account. my retirement's been spent, my savings is gone, my immediate family's robbed my mother of everything she had to the point where now i'm the one causing her hardship. 

i used to be fit. i could run 10 miles, i could dunk a basketball, i could lift weights. now i'm happy if i can lift myself out of a chair to use the bathroom. 

i used to be reliable. i used to be a good friend. but as this.. depression consumed me, i sunk so low as to miss my best friend's funeral. 

my dogs have died, between steroids to prop me up and meds to make me ""happy"" i've gained 80 pounds, and even my mother's said ""if you didn't drive me places i don't know what you'd be worth."" 

that's where i am, five years out from making a disgusting, unearned amount of money and living a lifestyle i didn't deserve but happily accepted. now i'm living the lifestyle i deserve and i don't want it. i've contacted government programs, been institutionalized six times, gone through countless medications, therapists, social workers and hotlines. 

so what's left after that? when the hotlines say ""there's nothing we can do for you"" and you don't have insurance and you can't afford a taco much less an inpatient stay at one of my fine state's torture wards?

- i suffer from chronic nausea, dizziness and headaches, especially in the evening and morning (all in all since 2 years now) and nothing is helping against that
- i left my family and friends for my now ex boyfriend with whom i had been together for 3 years before moving to him 300km far away

- i'm taking an apprenticeship (1 more year to finish it) and i hate the person that it made out of me and i can barely live without financial worries from my salary
- thus, i depend on the support of my parents, i hate nothing more than being dependant from somebody..i can't even give them back something besides tears they're crying for me because i'm giving up on myself 
- i completely fail at finding people who i can sympathize with...people that make me smile rather than cry
- the last and most painful reason: i fell in love again - with a person who is heaven and hell for me ...i love him so deeply for he has comforted me and made me smile after the break-up with my ex.. he listened to my worries and motivated me to live on
- we eventually came together pretty fast because we were yearning so much for each other (a hard act in itself because we were both fresh singles and somewhats not prepared for a new relationship) ..though we managed it somehow, on the top being in a far distance relationship and seeing each other approx. every 2 weekends
- the hell part: sometimes he is cold-hearted and saying things that completely obscure my actually warm and happy mindset..sometimes he is abusing me and treating me like garbage..still i love him, his warmth and smile ;
no matter how he treats me, i can't bear the thought to hurt someone again by leaving him
i promised my ex who happened to be my soulmate for all this time to never hurt someone again like i did with him
..so i'm sitting here waiting for hell to end itself and for losing heaven, too, the last glance of hope i have.. 
- and then there's my curse to feel too many things and to intensely...i get down over every single small punch that hits me

my thoughts for the last few weeks only circle around death. and there's no one i can trust...no one who wants to understand my crippled mind. now i'm here.. probably missed out  bunch of side information or even a common thread.
what i want...or at least what i think that i want is a new thought to fill my mind with and get rid of 'death' and 'self-hatred'.

"i'm just exhaustedeveryone's better than me, and i thought i'd come to terms with this, but apparently not.

god, we need to get rid of that universal ""gifted"" program in elementary schools.

i don't hate people that are better than me, how could i? i just blame myself for not trying hard enough, not being good enough. i feel like a sham. everything i've made myself out to be, i'm not. i'm good at nothing. i'm mediocre, will never stand out, will die one day and be forgotten within a year. all of my friends are so sweet and smart and pioneering, and i love them with all my heart. they deserve the world for their efforts and the success they've made for themselves, even if they're only juniors in high school. fuck, i'm only a junior, but it feels like there's no hope for me. it's too late for me.

i know so many amazing and talented sophomores as well. they're all so amazing, so kind, so charming. i could never be like them. god, i'm so pathetic. these people, if they run into a problem, they work to solve it and overcome it. i don't. i give up. that makes me a failure.

i thought i'd come to terms with all of this. i guess i haven't, and i hate myself for it, because i just feel so petty and narcissistic. i want to tear out my brain and rip it to shreds, replace my personality with someone else's. i don't have the looks to get me through life, either. i'll never be confident enough to own what little i have. i'll never be confident enough to transition.

nobody cares about me, or they try, but can't. i don't blame them at all – that's the one thing i can say with confidence. i don't blame anyone now. i used to blame the world for the problems i'd created for myself, but now i can see that whatever pain i'm suffering now, i've brought it on myself one way or another. i don't want to burden everyone else with my suffering, because they have enough stress to deal with. they shouldn't care about me. if i spill, they'll just push the responsibility onto someone else, someone more ""qualified"" anyway, and where will that land me? back at the therapist. expensive, pointless therapy that just makes me hate myself more, makes my mom hate me more, makes my dad hate me more, because it's a reminder that i'll never change, it's a reminder that i'm just a financial burden and a huge fucking mess.

everything treats me so patronisingly, because they know what i used to be in middle school. that whiny, privileged bitch that just kept moaning about his depression and anxiety and mommy issues. i'm ""edgy"" to them, still. i'll never be anything more than that ""quiet kid who draws"", the ""one with the resting bitch face"", the ""scary one"". i don't think they hate me, or maybe they do? i just know that they think i'm pathetic, and they listen to me and they're all nice to me, but it feels like they're all babysitting me, entertaining my garbled nonsense and cooing at me. the diction here makes me sound bitter, i'm aware, but i truly don't blame any of them, you gotta believe me on this. fuck, i don't want to be a more shitty person than i already am.

i thought... i genuinely thought i was getting better. but last year and this year proved me wrong. i'm still the useless mess i was in middle school. i'm still the absolute miserable ass i have been all these years, the attention whore, the prideful and jealous douchebag. i thought i was making friends, and fuck, maybe i did, but they don't like me, not really. once again, just playing along with me. i'd rather they beat me up and spit in my face, because this hurts more, when it's so vague that i'm left questioning whether or not i'm exaggerating it.

i just don't want to be a burden anymore. i don't want people to care about me, if they ever did. fuck, is it arrogant of me to think that people cared about me at all? i'm so ridiculously self-centered. it's time i gave back to the world. people will move on. if i'm going to die a nobody, might as well end it sooner, make it easier on everyone else. but i don't want to die, not really, i don't think. i don't want to live, either. i just don't want to have any responsibilities, and i don't want to be a responsibility. i wish i could just pass in my sleep. i wish i could trade my health for someone who is dying, someone who deserves to live, someone who can become a great person. i'm wasting space. i don't deserve any of this.

fuck, i'm pathetic. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. absolutely disgusting. i don't need to have a conversation, thank you, i just needed this. i don't know if i'll kill myself, but i should. is that even serious, then? doesn't everyone want to kill themselves every once in a while? i'm not special. i want to stop thinking. i wish someone would gut me.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"feeling lost and wanting to die[f 21] this is a throwaway account.  i’m tired of feeling lost and want to die. i don’t know who i am or what i want to do in this world. i feel like a square peg in a circle here. i’m in my first year of college, i’m autistic, and have reading comprehension problems. i was originally majoring in psychology. ever since i was 16, i wanted to become a clinical psychologist. this semester i scheduled intro to psychology 2, intro to biology, statistics, and the first year seminar. when i scheduled the classes, i didn’t realize how much of a overload it will be, and how much my reading comprehension sucks. i struggled to keep with the psychology reading while doing everything else; we had to read 100 pages for each psychology exam. so i ended up withdrawing out of the class last friday. now i feel lost and don’t know what to major in anymore. i don’t want to drop out of college because i have nothing else to do with my life. lately, the feeling of wanting to kill myself has been stronger. the thought of dying actually gives me a pleasant feeling. if it weren’t for the high botched suicide rate and also having parents, i would try to kill myself.",suicide,suicide,1.0

had some nice sex last night. made me feel close and connected and not guilty like lately. lately when i feel close to him i want to break down and cry since i hate myself so fucking much and all he wants to do is love and fix me. but oh fucking well. he can tell when i'm depressed but i'm never going to jump up and say hey i wanna kill myself woooo! wish i could fucking self harm!!! no. instead i take a bath or go in the pool and think about how i wish i fucking drowned. but i don't. that's noisy anyways. 

can't tell anyone at work. they'd think i'm weak or just weird. i'm not a bitch and i certainly don't have a reputation of being a hardass but for fucks sake i don't want to tell anyone. even my closest friend.

"college hellhi everyone,
it seems as if i have reached the end of a very long tunnel, a rock bottom.
i have suffered from depression for years, but never has it been this bad. i am healthy, am surrounded by people who love me, and am at a great university, yet the thought of getting out of bed each day is unbearable. 
every interaction with another human leaves me wondering if they hate me. i can’t see why they would like me, and i try to convince myself otherwise but it is impossible. i am disgusted with my body, my embarrassing personality, or my lack thereof.
i am a shell of my former self. i crave love but i will never allow myself to feel. i get blackout drunk every friday and saturday because the only way to ease the pain is to not remember it. i suffer from dp/dr, which makes like a living hell and leaves me begging to live a life in which i can believe is real. 
and so ends a simple story. a desperation, longing for some sort of comfort maybe. my mind is empty yet racing. 
please feel free to share your stories (i love to listen). i hope that maybe, with the social media scam that college students often portray, some can find their stories here.",suicide,suicide,1.0

people are so fucking fickle, it feels like i can't trust them anymore, no matter how sweet their words are. i feel like the sun is weighing on me every day, waiting to burn me to a crisp. and because of that, i fucking loathe the faux sympathy people put up.

can't blame them though, there's so much awful shit we see every day it's numbing us.

it's almost as if people still have a very idealized perspective on mental illness and just go off the ""don't worry, everything will be ok! let me coddle you so you stay in your escapist bubble"" because they don't realize that isn't healthy.

the way mental health culture is, particularly online, just pisses me off in ways i'm not sure how to articulate. it's like people just want to keep you in this state so that you can keep being the way you are with no improvement.

i wouldn't doubt if the pharmaceutical industry added to the sickeningly infantile ""please keep taking your meds, and breath! you're a worthless sack of shit worth nothing to society, but that's ok, you're human &lt;3"" attitude that people have when talking about mental health.

the fucking dark aspects of it are glossed over to keep up with the plastic image of society. i'm so fucking done with you. no one will know i exist 500 years from now, if the world will even exist by then, but god and my family.

and i'm fine with that.

let me do my work. that's all that really matters, and you know it.

you still eat hershey bars made from child slavery. you still buy nike shoes. the idea that anything else really matters is naïve.

i'm putting my all into my art. it's all i really focus on anymore besides school and helping my family.

no, i'm not gonna let somebody tell me i need to ""relax"", and encourage me that i'm fine the way i am. and i'm not gonna let your words define me, and break me down into what you want from me.

my family gets worried about the amount of time i spend just working. i take breaks of course, but i'm pretty much addicted to it.

maybe it's just a reaction to all the procrastination and laziness i see in people that pisses me off, or to know i was like that once.

maybe it's just me being tired of people not keeping their word.

"i am very severely selective mute, i can speak to strangers, but not my own family. i don't know what to do anymore. [m/16]i am 16 and as a result of not receiving full attention as my dad had to be looked after for the first 7 years of my life (motor neurone disease)/not having a father figure etc, i developed a very bad selective mutism, where i cannot speak to my own family properly, and i can only do basic words and phrases, going beyond makes me feel like hell all over my body.


i live in the uk, so the doctors wont do anything and the mental health treatment is pretty much non existent, i haven't even been diagnosed because they don't care at all.

**but it gets worse**

my brother and sister never attempt to talk to me, i am an outcast, and i am pretty sure that they actually believe that i have severe autism or am retarded in some way, this is because they have never seen me speak to my own friends and strangers in a normal way (and it would kill me inside if they do, thats how sm works).

my mum cares about me, but doesn't realise the full extent, she has recently tried to help me by 'talking to me more like an adult', thanks.. i guess.. i mean i am 16 so it's about time. it doesn't help at all though, she doesn't understand my situation.

before anybody suggests, no i **cannot write notes to them, it is a full on block on communication**.

this is probably my tenth or so cry for help on reddit, i am losing hope, i must keep going but i am losing hope. can you imagine being silent inside your own house, being scared to talk around your own family, for 16 years and counting!? just imagine, not being able to have a conversation with any of your family members, it's essentially like being an orphan, but worse in my opinion. why? 

i cannot have friends over. they cannot be in the same house as me or any of my family, as the thought of my family hearing me talk normally kills me and i cannot do it in front of them.

one time my mum insisted i have a friend round for a weekend, so i did. it was quite horrible, sure it was fun when i locked the door and played games in the attic with him, but when i went down to eat at the table with me him and my mum, i sat in complete silence. complete. silence. and he was probably wondering what the fuck was going on, nope just completely normal for me.


**i need help**. but i don't know what to do. i really do not know what to do anymore. i am 16 and i am running out of time. i don't even know if this is curable, i don't even know if it is too late for me, for all i know it could be, i could live a life without talking to my own family, and to me, that is the worst thing that could happen, and i'm not sure if i could live with that. 


i don't know how to go on, sm has been the cause of my depression, and it is the one thing that is holding me back from curing my depression (i can't not be depressed and have selective mutism at the same time, it is not possible for me).

"i've seen the consequences, just give this a read.  hey guys, i'm hoping some people who could use the words will read this. i recently posted on another thread and wrote about how i've been through 3 suicide attempts, 5 hospitalizations. the responses made me want to help other people if even a little bit possible.

[i apologize in advance for how long this will be]

  i can understand the dark place that some of you are sitting in. some people will always say things about how it will get better in time, but that hurts to hear when every minute of your life is dragging by at an unbearable rate. pain skews time, it fools us even more than usual. when you're deeply depressed, the rock bottom moments drag by slowly and at a point you don't even fight it because there's stability when you can't get any lower. and then when you have good days or moments, you can't fully enjoy them because deep down you know it will just pass. this is something that people who have never been severely depressed will ever fully understand, but you can't hold that against them. they give their advice out of love, and there is a world full of people who do understand who will be willing to help you.

  suicide attempts have left my life in such a complete mess. i have medical bills that i'll likely never pay off, my credit is ruined at age 22 - with nothing to show for it. my police record shows the results of my self harm, and i'll likely never be taken seriously if i were to have to go to court for something serious. i can never - for the rest of my life - join the military. i can never donate eggs or be a surrogate mother. but the worst result of all this is that my family will never be able to forget it. some of them responded coldly, some of them with pity. if i start getting somewhat unstable, i have to see my mother look fearful and hopeless because deep down she's wondering if this might be the final time i go through with it, the time she'll have to bury her daughter.

  you may think the solution here is to just go through with suicide so there's nothing left behind. but, the chances of that happening exactly as planned are really low. the negative consequences of my attempts are nothing compared to what some people will live with. even a gunshot to the head or hanging yourself won't always kill you. chances are the result could be severe brain damage, or a physical paralysis that you'll then never be able to end on your own.

  
 i know this may get looked down on, discussing the consequences rather than just avoiding the idea all together. but this is the reality of it. now, as i stated before i've been hospitalized 5 times, but only 3 were for suicide attempts. the other two were times i got so close, but realized i could seek help. i went to my local emergency room, and was sent to a hospital to rehabilitate. i didn't have to stay long, just long enough to stabilize. those visits weren't held against me financially, and i had experiences in the hospitals that would help me for months and years to come. sometimes it wasn't even because of the doctors or the medications. sometimes i just met people who shared experiences that would alter my views. it gave me a chance to step out of the game for a little while and look at my life from the outside, which can completely change how things are evaluated.

  it's just a better choice. i can't tell you that you need to look forward to the rest of your life, that things will get better, because i don't know. but just for now, if you're really on that edge, try going to get help. what more do you have to lose?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"42 summers is not enough, but psychological pain is too muchthinking about doing it by end of month, crippling depression and anxiety missed with some hardcore regrets, have pushed me to the edge. just don't want it to effect my family (mom currently is battling cancer) and coworkers,  but might just have to do this crazy thing. i have been researching methods, repercussions, afterlife, karma, and reincarnation lime crazy for last 1.5 months. don't want to do it but my ocd is driving me nuts and need relief, but worried about long lasting soul implications. 

i would never recommend doing the deed to anyone out there in reddit world--please don't do it, its not worth it. please let me convince you not to and why.

"stressed (technically self-imposed) and ready to give up.hey, sorry if this becomes a bit of a ramble, or seems kinda silly. i mostly just need to vent, and maybe get advice if anyone has any.


i've been planning my suicide to be on wednesday, the 11th of july, but part of me is reconsidering, yet i feel like i'm screwed if i don't do it.


i'm mostly scared of hurting my family and my friend, not to mention potential costs and the trauma that i imagine would come from seeing any person dead, though i'd try to have it be as clean as possible. i'm also scared of it failing, since hospitals aren't cheap.


moreover, life has been relatively decent recently, largely because it's summer break. for me, tasks such as washing dishes, showering, or cleaning my room aren't a problem at all like it can be with other folks -- and i am very grateful i have the energy for those things. yet at the same time, i struggle to do the things that actually *require* doing.


see, i'm going into my senior year of high school, and the schoolwork has piled up because i can't get myself to do anything. i've never dealt with stress well, which makes me procrastinate more, making it a hellish cycle of never getting anything important done. i still have a lot of work, and i really don't think i can get it done in a month (for a bit more context, i'm in a somewhat high-pressure honours programme, so we get more work than the average class). and although i do try to get started, nothing i read seems to register. it's essentially in one ear, out the other...though i guess that phrase doesn't work with eyes. i try to start working, and i just *cannot* concentrate. i just remember everything else i have to do and shut down.


it seems really melodramatic -- and no, it's not *just* because of schoolwork -- but i cannot handle this stress. at all. i'm so scared of hurting anyone, but the stress is tearing me apart, and even if i manage to accomplish all that, i still have to go to school, which always makes me feel significantly worse mentally (especially because trying to talk to people sometimes makes me freeze up or unable to breathe).


i'd like to be able to talk to my parents about it, but last time i told my mum i was suicidal (when i was around 11-12), she just told me to go to sleep earlier, gave some meaningless platitudes, and never really talked about it again, which really didn't help much at all.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i feel uselessi have thought about doing this post for a while but never actually did it because i couid'nt translate my emotions into words, i will try to do it this time around.


i am a 19 year old boy from portugal, currently in college. i am an extremely shy and awkward person and i have lately been feeling really down.


i feel like i will never become a useful part of society. i cannot imagine myself working anywhere due to my very low social skills. being awkward for as long as i remember myself alive has affected me in a couple of ways. i have never had a girlfriend and i currently have about 4-5 friends that i don't see irl for about 2 years. i haven't been able to make friends in college, in fact i've barely spoken to anyone irl outside my family for maybe a year or so. i do not leave home unless strictly necessary. i've never gone out for drinks with friends. when i leave the house i feel like everyone is looking at me and judging every single movement i do or how i look, which makes me really self-aware and even more awkward. this has made me left the bus on my way to college for literally no reason a couple of times.


and the most frustrating part of it is that i cannot find a reason for why i am so useless and sad. my parents are amazing, they work really hard for me to be able to go to college and i'm not even enjoying the major i'm pursuing but i don't have the courage to tell them they just wasted 1000 euros on me. i have never ever been bullied. i've had amazing classmates especially in high school that would try to integrate me into their social events and were overall very friendly. there's no reason for me to be sad.


i would be lying if i said i haven't had suicidal thoughts, i have, but i think i will never kill myself because i am too much of a coward to go through the painful process of it. but if there was a magic button in front of me that would erase me without pain i would press it without thinking twice.

"is she dropping hints? so i'm friends with a girl from school who is kinda cute. yesterday and a few times before me and my friends were hanging and drinking punsch out after school, but i had to drive home so i had to stay sober.

yesterday she tried  to get me drunk and got me food. at the evening, she really wanted me to stay over (asked me last week as well) and we even watched her favorite porn together (idk what that means). also she flirts with me a lot. 

now her friend told me that i had to stay the night with her and but i don't know if she wants that as well.

so anyways, do you guys think i'm in the friendzone or she is interested? i know she has a crush on another guy too. thanks for reading and love you bros",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

i am 16 yo and in junior year (or the equivalent since i live in france). and i am so stressed out because of school. like, it is terrible. basically i have a lot of tests and i need to have great grades to do the job i want. and this stresses me out so much. somehow i manage to procrastinate still and then cry because i didn't do anything. i am in this vicious circle where i don't work or study for i don't know what reason and so i get super stressed and it prevents me from working because i can't concentrate. and this ruins me. i cry and i want to punish myself and sometimes end my life to prevent from stressing even more because of this. (i will not inflict any pain to myself, but i really think about it). i don't know when this will end and how because i have so much years of studying left and i don't know if or how i will make it.

"about to snap. losing all hope.i just lost the girl of my dreams in a pretty rough breakup. known her since i was 12 years old, and now she's completely cut me off. it's the only relationship i've ever had, and i don't know how to deal with moving on from it. i thought i was going to spend the rest of my life with this girl. 2 weeks before we broke up, she stopped talking to me, and said she doesn't want to deal with this right now, then broke up with me on friday. 

the past 2 weeks have been so hard, because i didn't know what was going to happen. i fell into depression, and now that we have broken up, i'm falling deeper, and deeper into a hole. 

i used to have a self harm problem, where i'd use razor blades to cut my leg. last night i did just this, and i feel awful. i feel like i'm about to snap, and i know that, if left alone, i'm going to do whatever my thoughts are telling me to do.

on top of this, i have an undiagnosed stomach problem that i've had for over a year now, which makes me feel sick all the time. it's gotten worse with the stress, which isn't making me feel any happier.

i feel all the thoughts in my head getting stronger and more intense every day. i feel like an empty shell. i'm thinking about doing stupid things, and i'm losing control. i've decided to book a counselling appointment with my university, but i don't know how long it will take to get an appointment. i need help, before i do something terrible to myself.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i just want to feel normal. life lacks purpose and thats been really fucking with me lately. i've been severely depressed since year 10 (uk) and always had anxiety issues with both just getting worse and worse. i'm 17, college dropout and cant find a job. i want to die but i don't want to kill myself, i just want it to end, or change but that change just wont happen seeing as it's all caused by some fuck up in the brain. i've went to kill myself many times but i just couldn't jump. i always got too scared lol. which leaves me feeling like an even bigger failure. i stopped self harming about a year ago but i always look at the scares and urges come back, and recently i've been getting worse again and i'm constantly thinking about burning myself because i'm desperate for some sort of rush. i need to feel alive, i crave constant change in my life and i feel like that's going to end up biting me in the ass. like i'm probably gonna fuck up so many jobs because i'll get bored or i'll move onto harder drugs just  because i'm bored of the ones i'm doing. 

i just feel like it's all so pointless. even if i do die at old age i'm just going to get forgotten about in a few years at most so why not end now? i just feel like an empty husk.

during sex he had a breakdown and started talking about how his physically abusive ex got him hooked on meth, and he cried for like, 20 minutes.he then asked if i was comfortable with him doing meth so he can enjoy sex better and be happy- i said no, i wouldnt be comfortable

probably should have left here, right? stupid me stayed for a bit longer and fucked him some more .during anal, he stops and says: you can put your pants on. okay, he wants me to leave, so i leave.

he texts me 2 hours after (he's admits to being high on meth) and asks for me to come back because he's lonely, when its made apparent i wont come back he tells me he's going to kill himself because he has hiv. i had a panic attack/meltdown and went to the er and now ive been on pep (post exposure prophylaxes- it reduces the chance of contracting hiv) for like, 2/3 days. also my co-workers have been joking about my (possible) hiv status by saying ""stay positive"" (my boss told them- i told my boss because i was in the er and thought i was going to be late)

im scared, alone and well, terrified. i havent told my family because im 18. i have no friends or anyone to confide in. if im positive im going to kill myself. i already have depression/anxiety and have been close to suicide before. this might be the thing to push me over. ive been in tears over the past few days.

"i'm a useless existancemy life is worthless, i fucking hate myself, nobody cares about me. i was born a mistake and born differently, born to hate myself because of my own appearance and because i'm different. i never asked for this life, i never asked to be mixed, i never asked to breathe. racism, rejection, neglection, is all i've ever been through ever since the day i was born. my real dad beat my mom and left when i was very little and my step dad was racist and hated me. he taught me to hate myself and hate everyone else, he taught me to stay away from people. that's my reason for severe anxiety. he said he was sorry and he isn't like this towards me anymore today athough he is still a major dick and still a little racist sometimes. i just don't think he will understand what he has actually done to me. he destroyed a part of me and i will never recover from that. my mom has left me alone with him and my brother and sisters a couple of years ago. my full sister has completely left me alone with them because my step dad and her would always fight and argue. she doesn't even go to my school anymore so i can never see her. the only reason i think my step dad wants me to stay with him is so i can be used by him. school has made me want to kill myself for years. ever since 9th grade when i tried to kill myself because i was being bullied and framed for making fake accounts on facebook. everyone hated me for it even though it wasn't me. like my ""friends"" or anyone else actually cared about me anyway. school before and after my suicide attempt has just been so dark and completely going downhill at home too. my dad fighting with me, drinking, and being a jerk. everyday is just so repetitive i feel like i'm slowly losing my sanity. i spend the majority of my time locked in my room completely away from everyone. i stalk this very beautiful girl i like on facebook sometimes. i look into her life and see how beautiful she is. i see how she is so happy hanging out with friends and actually doing things. she seems to have a great supporting family too that can actually get her things. i think about that, i think of how i would love and do anything to be her. she is super smart and just so beautiful. she can get straight as in all of her honors classes and i see her going to college. unlike me an ugly poor dumb peice of shit in special ed classes. i kniw i'll never be abke to go to college. i score a 13 on my act even though i tried my hardest. so basically if you don't score a perfect score on a test you have absolutely no reason to live right? because that seems like what the school is telling me. but this girl has the perfect life, perfect appearance, perfect everything. infact most girls are perfect. i may not understand but thats just the way i feel. i get rejected or completely ignored by every girl i have feelings for and i hate myself for it. i'm an ugly piece of shit with no motivation and no reason to live anymore. i'm about to turn 18 and my senior year is about to begin and and i just don't think i can do it. after high school i'll die a sad lonely death. i don't think anything anyone will say will change the fact that i am a terrible mistake. i just know i'm going to kill myself soon.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i feel badthis probably isnt the best place to post this but oh well im gonna do it anyway. my mind feels like its being completely pulled apart. ive been having a manic episode for the past few days but these past two hours have been a complete mess of shit. i dont really know whats happening. constantly jumping from feeling complete and utter hopelessness with an intense desire to commit suicide to feeling like i can do literally everything ive ever wanted all at once. i cant focus on anything and my mind is fucking running a million miles per minute. its taken me almost an hour just to write this down. ive been off my meds for a while now i just cant bring myself to actually take them so now i get to enjoy what me being a fucking idiot has brought upon me. im really scared and alone i dont know what to do its so late and i cant call anyone. i already stabbed my arm kinda deep and it was bleeding a lot but its sort of calmed down now. now it just really really hurts. does anyone just want to talk to me about literally anything at all please. i really dont want to be alone right now i just wanna talk to someone while i try to fuckin ground myself or something.,suicide,suicide,1.0

"returna lot has happened recently. new stressors, returning demons, and simply a total swing in my outlook. of course, i'm not usually peppy or happy, but i was sort of... in the clear for 3 weeks. no thoughts, no overbearing, dominating stress. just mundane, which is better than it is now.

fucking oswald.

i apologize in advance for how incoherent this post is and will be. it's more of a venting session for me to rant than anything else.

so, thoughts are coming back. 2 weeks until a major event, maybe i just won't go. i can't handle it. of course, if i even cry in front of my family i'll get thrown in a padded room (i don't have any history for thoughts or attempts they're just like that) not only that, but my emotional footing is falling apart and i can't bear to do any of it but doing anything about any of it or trying to avoid any unfavorable situation will not end well. what am i supposed to do, outright tell my family i have thoughts? bullshit. that's not going to happen. and then, there's oswald. i'm not going to specify what it did or anything because again i don't need someone to read this i just need to type it.

i'm falling apart. again, i'm a mess. and because it's just fucking middle school i can casually suggest thoughts, death, my own existential crisis or even my outlook on life. nobody gives a shit. i'm just some caricature of 'relatability' to these misunderstanding idiots. nobody means it when they say 'i want to die'. they can't possibly even understand it. of course, i've thought about my own funeral enough to understand that death is weird and i don't even want to think about it right now.

so, most of the time in classes i'm either half asleep due to utter lack of sleep (maybe 3 hours this week) that has become routine or thinking about how to die. and i refuse to tell anyone about it. sometimes i think, 'i have no means but blade, basically. no gun, no nearby river, no incredible height nearby. then again, if i'm really considering this it suggests pain my while alive was unbearable and constant, so i guess that works.' so i'm only staying for unfinished business or the mental health of those who love me. despite the fact the only person i actually love is straight, so i'm shit out of luck.

"something is wrong with me.i'm a 21 yr old male. i'm fat as fuck and i always feel like i ruin everything.. i feel like i have no friends. even though i live with 2 guys i used to call my friends. they didn't do anything i'm just always frustrated now or just sad and lonely. i tried to quit smoking but now i've started drinking to hide how hurt i feel. i keep thinking if i just drink until i passout tonight it'll be ok tomorrow but it wont.


i'm sorry if i'm wasting yalls time. but i keep thinking about killing myself to end all this shit but i'm too scared to do anything now, i'm just afraid one day i'll stop being scared. what the hell is wrong with me. some girl broke up with me in high school, 3 yrs ago, and i never learned how to move on. she was really mean about it but i just have no idea what to think. i'm always scared of social things, and i need to find some way to deal with this. i thought i let her go but i met a girl that reminds me of her on a trip over spring break and i don't know what the fuck to do. all the feelings came back. i tried to ignore all these feelings for a while but now i'm drinking in the hopes of passing out.


i know i shouldn't drink like this but i don't know how to deal with this stuff. i always hide my feelings from everyone. if i'm happy i don't mind showing it but if i'm sad then i hide it by being mad at people or things around me. i like this girl i met but she has a boyfriend! i know i shouldn't bother her but i like her. she probably hates me.


i am terrible at talking to girls. i just feel like i should be alone forever so i won't do anything wrong to anyone. please help me. i'm drunk now but tomorrow i'll probably feel just as sad or angry when i wake up. what do i do? i have no where to turn. i've fucked my life up miserably.


drunken edit: both sides of my family are alcoholic, either currently or formerly. i feel like i'm wasting everyone's time but i'm more honest when i'm drunk. i always hide my feelings unless i'm drunk. i feel like i should do something different. i'm the first person in my family to go to college in 20 yrs but i'm failing any classes but my german ones. i feel lazy and like i should give up. i'm sorry if anyone hates my post. i just don't know what the fuck to do.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"been suicidal for years, but don’t want to hurt my friends and family.that’s about it. i know any attempt at suicide would leave my loved ones devastated. knife, gun, hanging, drowning, gas, falling, whatever. my mum wouldn’t be able to handle it. my friends would worry about what they didn’t do. i’d be proving to myself that i really was a waste of space who couldn’t cut it in life and just took the easy way out.

but i don’t want to live. i’m so tired. i’ve been so tired for so long. every day waking up with exhaustion, anxiety, self-hatred, depression and dread is eating away at me. i’ve tried to think of “accidental” ways to off myself. can’t jump in front of a car, don’t want to endanger somebody else driving or on the road. can’t leave the gas on, live with family and and i don’t want to endanger them.

god, these are such stupid and childish thoughts. and i’m putting them out on reddit like it’s my own personal diary or something. i’m a privileged fuck, with nothing to complain about except my own self-destructive bullshit. i’m such a fucking waste of space, fuck.

today’s my birthday by the way. my loved ones threw me three parties. three. they love me so much. and i’m here crying and trying to understand why i’m feeling this way.

sorry to anyone who’s read this self-pitying post. i’m not committing suicide, no need to worry. i don’t know why i’m putting all this out here. i just want it to end that‘s all. sorry. feel a bit better writing it out.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"here is why i will end my life eventually. did post here a few times. but i never actually stated the real genuine reason why i tried to kill myself the other day (the ""goodbye"" post) and why i will be attempting time and time again until i get it right. 

the only problem is i don't want to hurt my family. that's my only problem and also the fact that i don't have access to a firearm but i can just hang myself. 

if you look at my post history you will see the main reason. i'm a closet lesbian and i will always be one. don't get it twisted though; i will never come out of the closet because i don't want to. i hate being gay as much as people hate pedophiles. i will never ever act on my feelings again (i have before) and will continue to keep quiet until i die. naturally or otherwise. 

if you're overly sensitive about homophobia turn away don't annoy me with your activist bullshit because i don't want to hear it. 

i have known i was gay from a young age but i was in denial. until i was in my teens then i admitted to myself that i'm gay because i thought it was okay. i thought it was okay to feel these things. but it's not nor will it ever be. so the reason why my life is screwed up is because of me. all of this is my fault. if i didn't let myself feel these things thinking that its okay, i wouldn't be in this mess. 

i have only met two people (on here) who feel the same as me. but that's it. from other gays and straights i get ""its okay, accept it"" or ""there's nothing wrong with it"" blah blah. 

**no**

stop being so fucking dense. i don't give a fuck if other people are gay. i don't care about what people do with their lives. i don't. be gay and happy. i don't give a fucking shit. 

but i don't want to be gay. *i* dont want to. 

i'm sick of other people not fucking listening to me, what i have to say and how being gay affects *me* and *my* life. i'm sick of it. i'm sick of people generalizing me with other gays. we are not the same. just because one gay person is okay, doesnt mean i will be. i'm also sick of people debunking everything i say as ""but you can just do this and that's similar to what straight people do. stop whining"". both from gays and straights, neither have ever helped me. 

i have a boyfriend. i have had plenty of boyfriends, not because i like it. everyone thinks and knows i'm straight and that makes me happy. i have had sex with 2 guys (very brief sex). as soon as shit gets serious, i bail on them. and do i feel bad? yes. because that's what i am; a horrible person all because of this disease. and mind you, i don't go after the nice guys, i turn them down so i don't hurt them. i normally just date assholes because we don't care about each other. 

and my life is actually okay otherwise. i'm smart and successful. but this one reason ruins my whole entire life. it squashes all my hopes and dreams and fucks me up completely. 

i'm not going to get into why i hate being gay because i know exactly what people are going to reply with because people are fucking dense, so i'm not going to bother. 

i have tried to get the gay fucked out of me, will be visiting a pastor soon and hopefully will undergo reparative therapy. and i'm not even religious in the slightest. i am excited because i could feel what normal people would feel. but if that doesn't work, i'll continue to live as a heterosexual until i die.

"hidont know where to start...
i have one brother and a sister i had a second brother who died in afghanistan
my brother and sister both live a life that is quite sad(have no friends/gf or bf and no career)
during my life at some point poverty hit us hard, me being the retarded one/last one had to suffer from this/ i was really fucking skinny cause there was literally nothing to eat
because of this  during my childhood i was bullied hard, i was mocked almost every day, got called a freak. faggot, pussy, the main problem now is relive those memories every day... even when i go to work, and someone makes a silly joke about me, i later go home and cry like a little bitch, i am just very broken inside.. i do realise i was not in control of anything during childhood,. i remember passing out many times from standing up too fast..problem was my mother was a bit insane or something, she saw us as some burden, told us quite often she wanted to die/wanted to get rid of us/terrorised us, by being extremely violent...(she locked me in the basement, cause i spilled something on my pants lol) the problem is everytime someone now says something bad to me, i literally rethink everything people have said to me, there is constantly someone in my mind who is telling me what a freak i am. at some point in my life when i got away from home, i tried to improve my life. i think i did for a short while lived a life where i could reasonably hope for a better future, but i never am accepted anywhere as a normal person, its like people can see i am broken, this has resulted in me being isolated. i am generally afraid of people...right now i am pretty depressed i am thinking about ending my life, cause i literally just think i am not worth this life...
so my life has pretty much been a nightmare, at the moment i am 25 years old i work as a cleaner, but i can not even use a hoover for a prolonged period of time cause these thought of being tormented will come back to my mind, and i get very angry, i have broken 3 hoovers at work, from smashing them against something..

*stares at the blinking cursor*

i'll start with this then. i have social anxiety disorder, this kinda makes life a bit difficult with it usually involving other people haha.
i was too scared and embarrassed to call the suicide hotline, so here i am, afraid that i'm going to hurt myself.

i used to think that i had everything i needed, a future, a relationship with my best friend *(side note: it's a long distance relationship)*, and enthusiasm for basically everything.
until my best friend broke up with me, more than once. the first time she broke up with me wrecked me emotionally. i threw up, i couldn't eat, i couldn't sleep, and i was alone. the reason she broke up with me was because she couldn't handle being in a relationship that made her happy (a bit more on that later). so she blocked me on every messaging platform. we weren't **that** serious back then, we never even said ""i love you"" to each other.

so a month went by and i tried to deal with the breakup, which i wasn't doing very well. and suddenly i get this message from her. nothing special, but it fills me with a bit of hope. lo and behold, this message turns into us getting into a relationship again. only this time more serious. we didn't facetime before because of my social anxiety, but i slowly started to make an exception. we felt comfortable, everything was going great. we talked about everything, and we both supported each other.

the reason she broke up with me because of that is because of her issues. she has some family issues that messed with her psychological and emotional development, which means that the 'best' way for her to deal with things in her eyes is to push everything away.

i started to get used to her 'breaking up' with me all the time, she apologized after her episodes, and we moved on. but only after she blocked me a million times. i think the way she did it and kept saying ""goodbye"" scarred me for life.

we started saying ""i love you"" too each other. it was the best feeling i've ever felt, looking into her beautiful eyes (even if it's through facetime) and telling her that i love her (and of course her saying it back). plans were made, dates were set. the long distance part hurt, but it was all going to be okay. a plane ticket costs basically nothing and when i turned 18, we would be able to live together.

this was of course all ruined by my now former drug addict friend. he's still a drug addict.

he kept fueling my now ex about how bad i am and how she should break up with me. this of course were the drugs talking, but she didn't know that and thought ""he actually knows him so it much be true"". this combined with her issues didn't end well for us. she trashed me, called me every bad word in and out of the dictionary, and pretended that everything was okay while wreaking havoc on everything around her. so she broke up with me, blocked me, and immediately moved in with some loser. but only after pretending to say i love you to manipulate me into saying something to her.

this was half a year ago. my former friend has since then apologized for his behavior (after denying everything) before returning back to his drugs.

my dad tells me that she will eventually realize that she's unhappy with the loser she moved in with and go back to me. 99% of the things he says are true. i can't live without her. everything i do feels useless without her and i miss her so much. sometimes she still texts me to say that she's depressed, asking for help, saying that she misses me. she also tells me to fuck off after that.

the pain only increases the more time goes by. my dad keeps saying that everything will be okay and that i just have to wait for her, but it's been half a year. i'm going crazy here.

there was also something about being semi-engaged to her, but i honestly don't know where to put that now.

we met in 2015 and i instantly thought she was cool. i don't know what to do without her.

that's about 1/3 of it. phew, venting kinda made me feel a little better.

"i tried, i really did.i have struggled with suicide for a couple months now. i always thought to myself, maybe killing myself is the best option, but i never that the balls to do it. the thought of waking up everyday was toxic to me, every night i would silently hope that i would die a painless death and never wake up. i have been a ""christian"" my whole life. i always looked down on those who committed suicide because i thought it was scientifically ""stupid"". its funny thinking about that now, im suffering my punishment now. i always wondered why suicide was a sin, why i would go to hell if i committed suicide, and why i was fucking born in this world. i didnt ask to be born, i didnt ask for this life, my struggles, my insecurities, my thoughts, my race, yet i would go to hell for declining what i would receive. i went for help, everyone would say they cared, that they want to help. every single one of them never fell through, i was crying out for help but no one came. i never liked the people who posted about their depression and suicidal thoughts, i always thought that they just wanted attention. i asked many personal friends for help. all ended with the same outcome, nothing. i always tried to live a life of helping others and being positive, but why does my life want to murder me after i've already died? i feel used everyday im tired of helping others and being abandoned shortly after. i prayed every night for help, searched for help, but nothing. my life is in shambles and my hopes and dreams have all turned into a painless death.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i broke up with my ex today.

then, potential new boyfriend messaged me, we talked, then we called, he seems really nice :d and it’s not a long distance thing, like my last. moving on too quickly is bad, apparently, but i feel kinda free rn.

"the rat theory with this post, anybody who knows me irl that sees this will very likely be able to piece together who i am, but fuck it, because i don’t care anymore. i have come to present to this sub my theory/analogy about life.

imagine a lab rat. the rat lives a routine life, within a maze. the rat is kept motivated by cubes of cheese placed by scientists throughout the maze. in the end though, the rat surely comes to resent the scientists, and almost certainly dreams and longs for an escape from the maze to a better life. simple enough, right?

i believe that almost every life can be compared to the lab rat. we are all rats, scurrying about in our own little mazes. we are kept motivated by the little cubes of cheese given to us by whatever higher power does or doesn’t exist (scientists). at the same time, we come to resent this same higher power for holding us captive in our shitty mazes, and we dream and work towards the hope that we one day escape to a greater life.

i implore each and every one of you to try to apply this to your own lives. embrace your inner rat. identify your maze, your scientists, and your own little cubes of cheese. most importantly, never lose sight of your dream of escape. don’t let the temporary substitutes for happiness that the universe gives you (cheese cubes) distract you from your true life goals.

"better off dying alone.the happiest way to live is to be alone. everyone you love will die. some people spend the time with their loved ones thinking just far enough into the future where they're together and happy. personally, all i can think about is that one day, i'm going to notice they can't jump as high as they used to, can't walk as far as they used to. they're starting to forget important things more often. the grey in their hair, the wrinkles in their face, the cloudiness in their eyes.

every phone call when they're away could just be the one that lets you know they were in a terrible accident. every hour past the time they were supposed to be home could just be the day they don't make it home.
when your pet dies, sure you can get a new one. you'll outlive it. a new spouse? one of you is going first. best friends? they'll replace you with  someone who will do the things you don't want to do.

"i'm not sure why i'm writing this.my life's a wreck and death is preferable. 

i guess i should start by saying i'm 28 and i have no one in my life anymore except my mother, who i live with. i have been living with her for the last 6 years and became a complete shut in with no motivation to do anything, not even the community service i was given that would keep me out of prison. a sentence i received because i wanted to keep my mother from going away for 4 years, but that can come a little later.

i was born to parents who were 15 and 18, mother father respectively. both were drop outs but my mother tried to make it work by working two jobs while my father sat at home and fueled his addictions, addictions my fathers mother (my grandmother) blamed and hated my mother for. but as it turned out my 16 year old mom couldn't work two jobs and pay the bills while taking care of a one year old while my father just got drunk and smoked crack, used heroin, on a daily basis. so my mother ended up giving guardianship to my dads parents, and she moved 4 states away to live with her own parents and try to sort her life out. i didn't meet her until i was 10, and i wasn't sure who she was. she sent presents every year for holidays and events, but my spiteful grandmother changed the packaging and labels and never told me who they were from. 

my father bounced around a lot after my mother left him, doing construction jobs to fuel his inclinations. we hardly ever spoke for years, i actually don't think i ever had a conversation with him until i was 16 and only because we started drinking and smoking pot together then. he lived next door to my grandparents once for a couple of years. i'd see him every morning as i went to the bus stop like clockwork puking up his last nights alcohol before starting over again. he never came to my birthdays but i had a cousin my age that was raised by my grandparents too, because his mom my dads sister, was likewise 16 when she had him. every year for his birthday my aunt would buy him a entire pig and recruit my dad to cook it over night in a pig cooker for him via alcohol and drug bribery. since his birthday was in july it ended up turning into my dads friends and a bunch of family having parties all july. its a memory that sticks since he never did anything for me. i assume alcohol or drugs would have convinced him.

this next part is really hard to say... i never told anyone all of this. i was molested ritually by the cousin i had to share a room and bed with for nearly four years, and also by an aunt at the same time despite they never knew each other was doing it. it started when i was 8. i've come to terms with it and it doesn't bother me, and i've spoken to / received counseling about it. that's not what is hard for me.. my cousins mother lived two houses over from my grandparents, and besides my male cousin she also had 3 girls all younger than us. my cousin, their brother, used to make all of us do stuff with him and each other.. i hate that i went along with it, and even more so that i never tried to stop it. but worst of all i went from being an abusee to an abuser myself. as in i ended up doing things with the girls that's making me feel like i can cry right now even thinking about it, just because i guess i was tired of being a victim. 

fast forward to 10 years old and the return of my mother. my mom showed up one day out of the blue. i guess she had ended up moving back to the same state and ended up getting married and tried constantly to call me and come see me but my grandmother never told me about it, refused her at every turn. she randomly showed up and kept doing so after regularly. she used to beg my grandmother to let me come stay weekends with her and even with me begging she still said no for nearly a year until she finally relented. i started to go alternating weekends and stay with my mom and the man she had married, and honestly it was bliss. i had my own room, i was alone in my own space. i had home cooked meals, not bologna and cheap hot dogs everyday with utensils out of a drawer layered in mouse shit.  (there was roaches at my grandparents too, and i ended up anemic because of lead poisoning from the houses old foundation. it was tore down after being condemned years later.) there was also 4 boys my age near my mother's place that i became fast friends with. i used to dread and hate every time that i had to return back to !y grandparents but being the introverted boy i was i never said a word about it. any of it actually, but one day i did. i was 12 when i asked my mom point blank if i could live with her permanently. she immediately hired a lawyer in secret and started the court process. within a year i was living with her, but it was far from simple and it left me with a mental image of my grandmother that sticks with me even now 16 years later. 

i had just gotten home from school and came home to find my grandfather waiting to direct me to their bedroom where i found my grandmother streaming tears and screaming at me. you see she had just had a risky open heart surgery a few months prior, and she had just received a phone call and found out that my mother had hired an attorney. she didn't start screaming until she asked me if it was true and i told her flat out yes, i wanted to live with my mother. she yanked down her shirt and pointed to her scar and screamed that everything she had been through was for me, that i was abandoning her for that worthless bitch and i was breaking her heart. the next few months went by in a haze where she refused to even talk to me. i bottled it up like i did with everything, tucked it under the scars and put it in the void. (i forgot to mention my cousins mother and my uncles and aunts were extremely abusive. i've been stomped at 6 years old by a 300 pound woman for sitting too close to the tv and not moving back when she asked me to. that ended up with 4 broken ribs and shitting and puking blood for a week. the same woman also hit her own son with a frying pan full of hot grease because he snagged a piece of bacon, he has permanent white splotches down his neck from it even years later.) but a few months go by with my grandmother ignoring me while the court process went on, until eventually i was called up to be spoken to in private with only the judge, attorneys, and myself present, because of my age. i remember being asked a few questions and the judge deliberated with the attorneys before flat out saying he was going to leave me with my grandparents. i snapped, emotions just poured out and i cried for the first time in my life as i broke down, it all poured out. the abuse, the state of the house and my living conditions, everything. the judge dismissed us and told the attorneys that none of that was to leave the room. but it did leave the room. i knew as soon as i saw my grandparents return to the car where i was waiting after court ended. no one said a word but i knew. we went home and my father was waiting. he looked me dead in the eye and told 12 year old me i was a ""little fuck liar."" two months pass and still my grandmother wouldn't so much as sit in the same room with me when i was home from school. the court order finally came through and my mother came to my school at the end of the year and picked me up as a surprise, taking me to my new home. my grandparents found out and called the police but nothing could be done, my mother had her rights back. the only addendum was that i now had mandatory visits back to my grandparents on alternating weekends and summer vacations. but that didn't exactly pan out. my grandmother died of a heart attack at home within a week of me moving to my mothers. i can still remember the looks i received the weekend i showed up, remember the way she told me i had killed her, and i can remember my cousin telling me i killed her after she actually died. i saw that they blamed me. all of them, and it was never the same. even at her funeral i couldn't cry. for 26 years the only tears i ever shed were in that court room. my mother went to her funeral with me and even she was crying about it and they hated each other. but life went on.

from 13 - 17 i was happier than i had ever been, i was in a supporting and caring home with a non abusive family and friends and a good school life. but around 16 the rebellious stage kicked in. i started becoming mischievous, smoking cigarettes, weed, drinking. i was eben doing it with my father on my trips back to my grandparents. the abuse stopped once i moved out of course and none of us ever spoke about the things we had done, my cousin, the girls, we all buried it under a rug. but my happiness turned to resentment as i noticed my mother was far too lenient. she could never bring herself to punish me for anything i did. stealing money, smoking, none of it. shed attempt to ground me and falter the next day. i knew it was guilt on her part but i couldnt help but push the limits, going so far as to skipping school when i got my license with more days missed than went by a long shot. i was expelled my junior year, yet even though i knew my mother was angry she never showed it. and like a shark i went at that weakness. now i know i just wanted her to scream at me, i wanted to be told i was a fuck up and to get my shit together. but she never did. in fact the happy little life on the outside crumbled too, when i was 17. 

my mother got into a bad car accident and ended up on disability. she was a nurse but she was no longer allowed to work. she was given pain meds after back surgery for years and it changed her. her relationship with my stepfather crumbled and she ended up moving out, leaving me with him, to stay with one of their mutual friends. he thought it was temporary and didn't mind me staying there with him but aftrr a year of her being gone that changed too, even more so when it came out that my mother was fucking her friends husband, the married man she was staying with and also my step dads best friend. it caused massive problems. when this all happened i was 17, close to 18, but it opened my eyes. on my own i enrolled in an alternative school and crammed a years worth of classes in one semester so i could enroll back into my primary highschool. i ended up graduating on time by my own graces but by the time i did i was 18 and still staying with my stepdad. he had always been an alcoholic, drinking acase a day but he was never violent. but once it came out what my mother had done he, rightfully, was pissed. he started drinking liquor oiut of the bottle, talking to himself at night, glaring at me when i came home from school or work. i knew i was no longer welcome and i didn't blame him. my mother left for a year to fuck his best friend while i was left there like luggage. not long after that my mother and stepdad filed for divorce and my mother and i ended up moving to a small trailer a county a way. i applied for college but because of my rebelliousness i needed a few credits more than what i had and was rejected. my only option was to do community college for a year before i would be accepted to uni, but at this point i had a pretty good job for a kid right out of highschool. good enough that i was essentially paying for the small trailer and the bills all on my own, seeing as my mother was kicked out of pain management for smoking weed and she spent her meager income on pills. most of my friends had moved on by now, gone on to join the military or off to uni. and then i got hooked on pills too. 

i started taking them around 19, and i truly loved the feeling. i saw immediately why my mother liked them so much. for a person who was always numb inside it was like a warm fuzzy blanket. we lived there like that for a year before my mother decided she couldn't handle being so near to the rumors and snarky comments anymore. (it was a small country town, stepdad was a farmer and everyone knew each other and even though we moved a county over it was still on the outskirts of the county line, closer to the city i went to school in and my job.) so she decided she was going to move back to rent a house next her own parents back in her home state. i decided i wasn't going to go. i had a good job and a few friends around still, sadly only junkies like myself at that time too, so i stayed on my own from 19 - 20. the whole while my usage just upped and upped until i was paying my entire rent on drugs and owed everyone i knew money. so i said fuck it one day after a year and called my mom and asked to move in and she said yes. i had a sort of epiphany, that i was just like my father during that year and that realization made me quit on the spot. i moved 4 states away to where i knew no one because i knew it was the only way i'd ever give up my bandaid that was opiates. so that's what i did. of course, it was harder than i thought it would be.

you see the house my mother rented was next door to my moms parents, my other grandparents. and my grandfather was prescribed / still is prescribed morphine because of cancer. he doesn't even have half of a lower jaw anymore because the bone had to be removed and the cadaver graft failed. not to mention my great uncle, my grandfather's brother was the one who owned the home my mother rented and he was a pill head too. he his it from his wife and used the rent money to buy his own drugs. the town we moved to ended up being far worse than the small country town i left drug wise, and trying to go cold turkey when i have family members around that would just give me whatever i wanted if i asked was not easy, but i spent three months holed up until finally the worst was over. i had a relapse or two but every time i realized that i was just like my family i'd quit again. i ended up finding a job and this lasted for nearly 4 years. but of course having pill heads around each other wouldn't last. my uncle who kept stealing the rent for drugs was lying to his own wife about it and they ended up getting a foreclosure on the land where we lived as well as my grandparents next door and suddenly we all 4 were homeless. they quickly rented a small trailer and i spent 2 months sleeping on a porch in an ohio winter with nothing but a tarp nailed to the outside. my mom slept with my grand!other while my grandfather slept in his rocking chair. it was a low point for sure. the job i had paid shit wages and no matter how hard i tried i couldn't find anything better. then i lost my job, my license, my car, all right together. i had a traffic ticket from my old home state i had forgotten about that caught up in the me when i tried to renew my license for that state. so i did a title loan on my car to quickly pay it off but within a few days i was fired from my job for texting in the parking lot. (yes, i'm dead serious. it was union contracted and extremely strict.) my mother and i ended up moving in with a disabled bed ridden man who was a family friend. on top of is staying there he also paid my mother for taking care of him (think home nurse) and i went along because he lived near a major city. way more job opportunities. it took six months of me job hunting to find a job and when i finally did the man we stayed with passed away within weeks and we were back to homeless and caught in a court battle over his assets because the man was wealthy and had added my mother to his will. a move the mans family was deeply upset about. he was never married and childless, so they were direct relatives. we ended up back at my grandparents while the court proceedings went on for that, which meant my carless self couldn't drive an hour with no license to work and seeing as i had not made any friends at all in my time here i didn't have a choice. my mother eventually got her ""inheritance"" and put a payment on a house. her inheritance came in two major checks at separate times but the realtor allowed her to make a huge down payment with a promise to pay another 20k in a few months as that was what the down payment should have been. it should have been easily doable considering the amounts she was receiving but it turns out that second 20k payment never made it to the realtor, instead she spent it all on pills over a 3 month span. we lost the house and back to homeless. luckily that was short lived as she found a boyfriend to live with and i stay there now too. but a lots happened over the last few years. 

i haven't spoken to a single one of my family members from my father's side in 10 years at least, though i did see an news article where my felon father got caught with an ounce of heroin a few years back and got 20 years for it. he has a long prior record, boasting even a statutory rape charge and the only family i had left here all hate each other now. my mother and her parents refuse to speak as well as my pill head uncle. i likewise got into a little trouble for driving under a suspension trying to dig myself out of debt enough to get my license back. this is why i'm now a felon myself and likely going to prison in a month. a few years back my mother sent me to my grandparents out of nowhere, she told me they called and begged to borrow money and asked me to take it to them so i did. i got there and grandfather asked me to take him to the store as his car was messed up and he needed some stuff so i agreed. he got some groceries and i took him home and went to make the hour drive back to where we were staying at the time. i moved over for a passing ambulance and didn't used my blinker and was pulled. i knew my license was invalid and if i was unlucky the car would be towed. i figured worse come to worse i'd just have to sit for 30 minutes waiting on my mother to come get me but it was worse than that. turns out during inventory of the car there was a bottle of morphine unlabeled under the passenger seat. i knew right away what happened and called my mother furious. in the end the cop gave me a citation and took a statement regarding the pills, where i said they weren't mine obviously. but the cop said to wait and they would decide whether to charge me after the pills were tested in the lab, and if i hadn't heard anything in 6 months then likely i wouldn't be charged. fast forward 2 years of silence and the incident all but forgotten and i have two us marshals and two local cops knocking on my door with a secret indictment. i went to jail for a few weeks and was released on bond while the rest played out, but i ended up with a court appointed attorney who flat out said the only way i'd get out of it is if my mother took the blame. well she had been caught with illegal pills already too, and though she became a felon she only ended up with 5 years probation. if she took the blame she wpiuld have gone to prison. i didn't have a single thing on my record besides traffic tickets so i took a plea deal with the plans to do my 10 days in jail and get out on probation with the remaining year over my head in the hopes of doing what i needed to do and having it expunged. yet here i am now, report twice a month a year and a half into my probation and i still haven't done a single hour of the 120 i need. i've tried but it just doesn't work out. i have no motivation do anything anymore. for the last year i've spent all my time job hunting and i've had a few who were interested until the word felon came up. the closest place to do community service to my house is walking distance away, but they don't take felons. 

i've essentially just given up, i genuinely don't care about anything and i never really have. i did see a psychiatrist a few years back where i received a antisocial personality diagnosis. i was given meds that never worked, sent to counseling and therapy too but to be honest it hasn't helped in the slightest so i gave that up too. and while i typed out a good bit of my life story here i realize fully that it paints me as a victim in most of it, but i'm not. the truth is i'm a horrible fucking person. ive done a lot of seriously horrific shit that i'm not proud of by any means. i haven't had a girlfriend in 6 years and i've never had a relationship last more than 3 months. i just can't do it. i'm empty inside and have no drive or prospects. most of my friends or girlfriends i've always fucked over by playing little games like a psychopath because i just can't let anyone get close to me anymore. i truly can't. i've only had two meaningful relationships in my life. one with a girl that i think i truly loved but it was fucked up. i was overbearing, jealous, paranoid, abusive, insecure to the max... i treated her like shit. and i knew i was doing it and couldn't stop and she was too good of a person to be crying every day. so i just cut her off and left. the other was my child hood friend that i met when i first moved in with my mother. one of the four guys. we were inseparable for years but life happened and we drifted apart, though we did speak for years after and meet up whenever he had leave from the airforce. which is something i was declined from as i am mostly deaf in my right ear from where my cousin shot a shotgun next to my head and perforated an eardrum while we were hunting as teens. i couldn't even join the army during the war, something i genuinely wanted to do. (yeah, i know now that sounds.) so here we are. no prospects, rapidly approaching 30, living with my mother, a convicted felon who's likely going to prison within weeks or months. depending on how long i can use my psychopathic charm to sway my po with lies, and it just seems so fucking stupid. i'm right back where i was at 10 years ago. my mother has changed with her addiction issue too. we never talk anymore, and haven't for years. when i ask her something i usually get a bitter snappy answer because her boyfriend now is an alcoholic too, but one of the stupid fucking kinds who likes to run his mouth and scream over menial shit. i've already had her drag me off of him because i had him against a wall and was strangling him after i got tired of hearing his drunk ass calling her names loud enough the neighbours could hear. the house were staying in is three stories including the basement, which is a separate homestead and where they stay. i sit in the upper two stories of this house all alone and have done so for the last 2 years. all i do is think about shit now. i've never really done that before, i usually am always optimistic and try to think everything will work out in time but the truth is that i'm tired of waiting. the truth is i'm more of a parasite now. my closest friend from back in the day was more of a rival in that we were always challenging each other in everything. who got the most girls, who was better at sports or fighting, and whatever else. it wasn't the type of relationship where sharing was a possibility. i've tried talking to my mother genuinely about myself, where my heads at, and it ended up with her bawling and running out of the room within five minutes. so i've never really had anyone i could talk to. i really haven't. the only girl i've ever loved i was too scared to pursue because i know myself too well. and that's even with her actively pursuing me back. i just couldn't put her through that. not her. and to be honest the only reason i haven't killed !myself now is because of my mother and only her. 

she's headstrong and hates people that fucks her over and she is almost always a raging bitch but inside she's a big softie who cried for a week when her pet rabbit died. a 40 year old woman crying over a pet rabbit.. what would a dead son make her do? i may not feel guilt personally but i know what it is all too well, and i can't do that to her. i can't let her find me at least, so my plan is to pack up a bag and some supplies and just head out into nature as far as i can and do it there. my mother knows me well enough to know that i'm the type of person who can cut off a relationship at the drop of a dime. so long as i'm never found by her then that's fine by me and if im never found at all that's all the better. i'm giving it a week.

i have never attempted to suicide before but i have had a few near death experiences. i've been shot during an incident back when i was doing drugs a lot, i've accidentally hung myself before, ive overdosed and passed out for three days where my old ""friends"" just took my money and my car and left me for dead, and i've drowned and had to be resuscitated. i know full well that i have a strong will to live and i know how that rush of chemicals after feels, how relieved and life changing it can be, but i've made up my mind. the truth is i really don't want to live in this society at all. my minds fucked and bitter and i don't deserve to be happy because i only bring misery along. for 26 years i walked through life like a metronome, a shell of a person just existing only because i can, because i was therefore i am. its only in the last 2 years out of my 28 that i've stopped and allowed it all to ruminate. the worst part is that i can cry now somehow, but its always over stupid shit. a movie or a manga i read, but real life nothing affects me. this isn't living, its just existing. i don't resent it or anything that's happened in the past, i just want to end it. whether there's a heaven, hell, absolutely nothing, a valhalla, or any of that doesn't matter. i just want out of this menial existence of isolation. sure i could find a job and slave away earning scraps of paper but i know i still wouldn't be happy. so i'm done. 

my bags already packed and waiting for my hike. i'm not leaving a note or even a hint about what i'm doing and that's for the best. only one person would know anyway and while i'm emotionless i don't get off on hurting others. its disgusting. i just want to disappear so that's what i'm going to do.",suicide,suicide,1.0

how can anyone commit suicide knowing the pain that it will cause to their loved ones?i felt depressed a lot before to the point of being medically treated with antidepressants. today i was thinking that in my darkest days i never actually thought of commiting suicide because of my loved ones. i wanted to ask how can someone commit suicide knowing that the act will literally destroy their loved ones and i literally mean destroy to a point that the people who loves us will continue with the same or a more enlarged depression that the one that committed suicide has. i just don't understand how is it possible? i'm not blaming anyone and i don't want to make people guilty but that reasoning helped me a lot through my toughest times. i really didn't have anything in my life that was worth but i knew that i didn't want to destroy and pass my depression to my loved ones even if that meant still having to carry that awful depression. at the time i considered myself lucky to know that i had people that loved me dearly and i know now that some people really don't have the knowledge that maybe someone else loves them but even if you don't know that you must think about the fact that maybe someone that you think doesn't care about you actually does and will be destroyed when you take your life and will probably depress them as much as you were. so how can one take that decision? please do not be offended by my question but i want a logical answer and i thought maybe i could help someone.,non-suicide,suicide,0.0

"i can't take it anymorethis is my first time typing something here and this might be long. i'm sorry if so.

i've been depressed for the past few years now. i'm 19 years old and right now i just feel like utter shit, like i'm hopeless and i cannot do one thing right that will make my parent(mother) be happy of me. i would say this started when i was in middle school, i got a bad grade in some class, i explained to my dad(who was on drugs on that time). he gets mad, grabs one of the medium-sized jamaican heads we had in our home and he hits me with it. the next day i go to my school therapist to discuss what happened. now before i had no idea what cps was, but according to her what my father did was enough to make the call.

so she calls, later on when i get home my mom calls me into her room. and instead of understanding my choice she blatantly bashed me, telling me that i was the one in the wrong, not my father. i was ignored and treated like shit for months and i never once, even now, received something that made me feel my choice was okay from them.

now into high school. at a young age my mom put me into track and field, a sport that i had a lot of talent in, even making it into the jo(junior olympics). however due to issues w/ money, my mom, bro, and i had to move to another city. long story short i did pretty shitty in track, i still have no idea why. while i was good in track and received many calls about colleges wanting me in their school, it just wasn't...me. i was only doing it for my mother because i know how happy it made her. but one night after a track meet she yelled and screamed about how i was ""embarrassing"" her - as if she was the one running her ass off and trying to impress her daughter. so that was it. i told her i quit and i just didn't nothing. 

my grades dropped sorely and i even ran to my hs therapist to tell her i wanted to kill myself. she calls my mom, who glares at me as if again, i was the one in the wrong, then swiftly leaves. i spend time in a mental institute, get out a few days later only for my mom to immediately tell me how disappointed she is of me. 

during the span on my senior year and now, i have thought of suicide many many times, but only actually did an action twice. my last one was last may and i od'd. i was in the mental hospital for a  week and only received visits from my father and my aunt(who i haven't spoken to for even seen prior for years). but guess who wasn't there for me? right. my mother.

just last week i told my mother i wanted to drop out of college because i literally had to motivate myself to go. example, i would lie to her saying the class got canceled when it actually wasn't. i was tired of trying to make her and others proud of me. instead i wanted to do something that would make myself happy. oddly enough, before she said i could do anything i wanted to do. and now that i actually decide it's just a giant shitstorm. she blackmails me about taking away my only connection to online friends(my irl friends abandoned me the moment i moved despite me sending texts to them). it was just around 15 minutes ago she called me into her room asking me what i did. i tell her since i'm depressed i stayed in bed and cried. however i did call a company for their app and prepared to send it to them tomorrow.

but no, she yells, tells me i won't get that job. long story short, she wants to control my life and i won't let her. i've been under her roof since i was born, and don't get my wrong i would love to move out. however i do not currently have a job so i cannot support myself. i cannot even explain how frustrated i am. i fear that if she takes away my laptop, not only will i lose contact with my only friends but i won't be able to write anymore(something that i've done for nine years). i've definitely thought about suicide again, however my friends and my father makes me push away that. but i admit the thought of never having to see my mother again or listen to her put me down makes me feel so good.

at this point i feel nothing for her. she could literally have a heart attack and i won't care. why should i? she's never been there for me. she's never causes me any sort of happiness, in fact she's a big reason why i've wanted to kill myself. according to her i'm always in the wrong, me me me. and i'm so tired. i'm mentally exhausted and i just want to go away forever to a place where i don't have to worry about things any longer. i don't even know what a mother's love feels like and i really want to. i want her out of my life and i want it asap.

the last time i tried to kill myself, no one cared when they found out. it was shrugged off like everything else. when i try to talk to someone, i'm told to ""not bring up things like that"" or to ""forget about it."" how can i forget about it when every morning i wake up i'm upset that i woke up? how can i forget about it when i'm reminded every day how no one wants me? how is *any* of this worth it? maybe everyone would be better off if i just finally disappeared.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i'm having a hard time at home and i hate it. i get hassled all the time and its full of bullshit i can't even bear it. i already advocated myself and then i get hassled again... i know it's stupid, but i thought i had a mutual agreement. i know my family cares about me but i don’t feel like i deserve it because all they've been doing is annoying the fuck outta me and not listening.

i even had worse. i went to residential for 2 straight up years after being sent to the hospital by an psychiatrist like 6 fucking times. gg 5 fucking years there. that's more than 1/4 of my damn life and most of my teenage life. i've seen hell, i've been through hell and actually those places had a fucking negative impact on me that it's almost like perm affecting me. fuck it really. i don't wanna see a place like that again or a staff member doing some kind of stupid shit. all those places actually killed my heart and ultimately got me to this point as well.

i’m feeling like i am very indebted to my friends and family. every time i try to talk to a friend on facebook or something, another friend of that friend of mine badmouths me and my friend calls me stupid as well. i fucking hate it like when i was at school i was a outcast and i never got into the fad teenagers are doing and people called me stupid. my friends really can be assholes and i have no other friends to hang out with. i can add that today, i just got betrayed and kicked out of a group. really like fuck life and fuck myself.

"i'm relatively new here, but i've seen enough for a life time of sadness. here is a thought.i'll be brief.

depression.

that's a taboo word these days, isn't it?

""depressed? what do you have to be depressed about?""

it seems like everybody knows your depression better than you do, doesn't it? which is weird. the word depression induces an awkwardness as if it's an indelible mark of shame on your reputation as a person, much akin to wearing a post-it note from your mom everywhere you go that says ""i'm glad you stopped wetting the bed."" 

it's difficult to get rid of it. it's difficult to be happy about it. it's like part of you that's unrelenting and, like cancer, could sprout up against. and you become afraid of it. afraid that you might relapse. that you might...somehow be weak enough for it to conquer you once more. 

personally, i'm not afraid. rather, i embrace it. depression to me isn't a fever that consumes me anymore, but a tickling of the ribs. it makes me laugh. **my depression** makes me laugh. don't confuse that with your depression. i own my depression, and i'm proud to acknowledge it. why? because i've passed it. i've reached over to my depression, gave it a hard look, and laughed at it. as if it meant held little power. and it does hold little power. so when you talk about depression, don't forgo the thought of discussion your own. because it's part of you. it's made you stronger. when you know extreme sadness, then happiness is bliss. and when you know bliss, there's absolutely no reason to ever get familiar with extreme sadness ever again.

so. feel proud of your depression. feel proud that you've conquered something to massive and internal. feel proud to tell others that you suffered through it. and even if they don't understand in the same way that us suicidewatchers do, feel proud that you were able to admit to it. live through it. and come out much more stronger than you entered it. 

you're all amazing people. it's a damn fine thing that nobody goes through the same unique situation. because when you come out, you're unique. that's right. you are unique. cherish that though. be proud of yourself.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

i've pretty much made up my mindpeople hate me and i think they're right to. i'm a terrible individual. i've had 6 people tell me to kill myself in the past year and i stuck it out longer than i expected but i think it's about time. the only thing that would stop me is how much it would tear up my mother and i'm not sure if she could go on and she's the only person i give a shit about. i'm pretty useless and fuck up everything i touch i can't hold a human relationship for more than a month unless it's with another sociopath. everything is an act nobody knows the real me and i'm not sure how much longer i can keep it up. i know i can do better i look pretty good and i'm good with my hands so my work options are pretty open but i can't hold a job for long without verbally degrading any coworker that crosses me. i don't like that i derive pleasure from making other people feel like shit it's just who i am at this point. i've been socially ostracized because i made a stupid mistake and didn't really know what i was doing but theres a large population of people that actively hate me and hacked my google account and shit they're probably reading this right now. that's fine by me i have nothing to hide at this point he even told me how to hit my jugular vein when i kill myself. i tried to go to another state and he still fucked with me. nobody is on my side it's like i live in a psychological thriller. i don't think most people would have made it this far with the shit happening to me. i already planned my funeral it's going to be nice and small about 10 people in an open field it'll be great. at first i got hung up on the whole heaven and hell thing but i've come to the conclusion that i'm no different from a spider on the wall that gets smashed into a tissue and forgotten or a cow to the slaughter. most people don't think about the cows emotions when they're eating at outback steakhouse or whether it's in heaven or hell. it's just kind of gone.,suicide,suicide,1.0

i did try though. within the last two years (in no particular order) i've managed to get a job after 3 months of unemployment, graduated from university with a first class honours degree, went from obese to normal bmi with a diet and exercise regime, joined social clubs and made friends, travelled independently, learned a new language. i even improved basic things like personal hygiene. all of those things brought temporary joy but ultimately resulted in me feeling even more distant to everyone and everything else than i had even imagined before. what more is there even left to try?

"i am happy and fulfilled in my life but i want to be gone/disappear dear folks, life can carry us into many directions yet i am battling some very specific issues. namely, i am 29 year old female, living abroad as an expat in eastern europe. i have undergone many challenging situations as a child, from sexual, physical and verbal abuse and the majority of my life i was aimlessly trying to drown my anger and frustrations in different ways, be it relationships, alcohol, gaming, changing the country. around my mid 20s i started picking up the pieces and forming myself into a healthy individual, i've read self help books, visited a therapy on a weekly basis for more than a year. so in the last few years i have done what i always wanted to do and fulfilled my life goals, ie got a stable job, a nice flat (renting, but still), sustainable lifestyle, good friends, fulfilling hobbies, ive learned piano, practiced drawing, visited every concert of every band i have wanted to (which was a big deal to me). i have even had all the sex i was interested on having and was lucky enough to travel to the vast majority of the places i wanted to see.  


everything that was ""up to me"" so to say, i achieved. one of the big wishes i had since the very early 20s, was to have a healthy relationship and become a mother. i have had huge struggles to sustain any sort of relationship as they all ended up with some alarming behaviour (and of course i was responsible for my nastiness as well,but i never disrespected my partners and i always tried hard to perserve it) therefore i had 4 relationship in life, lasting for at least a year, which ended in either unwillingness to move in together, extreme jealousy, cheating...you name it. i have eventually made my peace with the fact that i am simply not cut for it, i have done everything that was within my power, including long periods for myself only, not looking for anything ""actively"". i am not getting any younger, plus according to the gynecologist, it would be difficult for me to get pregnant anyway, so i do not want to be a disappointment. therefore i rather volunteered in a local shelter and helped people making their lives better in my free time.  


now here i am, left with no real responsibility, bound to absolutely nothing and no one and fulfilling what i could. i would, ideally, take a few more months to finalize certain things, ie to make the cookbook of my recipes for others to use, to describe my life lessons, i wanted to go someplace nice and peacefully pass away. i started planning the details, actually. mind you, i do not feel depressed, sad or hopeless per se, i just feel like i am somehow done. imagine,the feeling when after a long day of work and managing everything, you know, going shopping, taking care of animals, family, planning holidays etc., you are tired and you go to sleep? you think to yourself, sure,it would be nice to have a bubble bath and a sauna before bed, it would be awesome to go outside on the bedroom balcony for a cigarette and an expensive champaigne and relax on the water bed i kinda wanted to try, but hey, everything is done, i took time for myself and my needs, nothing or no one is left behind, i feel good about myself. that is how i feel about myself now.  


as it goes for the future. i know, everyone says that you can ""meet your partner later in life"" and so on, but i simply think it is too late for me, also because of the pandemics. simply, even if i by any chance meet someone tomorrow, that would take some time for getting to know each other, investing into a common real estate, getting pregnant, being pregnant, so best case scenario i have my first kid when i am 33, let alone second kid or potentially some more. assuming i am able to get pregnant in the first place. in addition to all that could go wrong - with children, with marriage, etc. therefore, even the stars would be perfectly aligned in this regard, so i rather made a painful decision to give up on the idea of it. do not get me wrong, i never put my entire happiness into the idea of having a family, despite the fact that my elderly grandma, living 4h away, is all the family i have and will ever have.  
apart from that, i am prefectly fine and grateful for everything and everyone i have. it seems to me i have ticket the checkpoints and am ready to wrap it up.  


my question would be, these ideas seem a little unconventional to me, but i have had them for quite a few months now and they are only increasing - is this normal train of thoughts? is it a phase, should i seek help? sadly, the offer of english speaking therapists where i live is very limited to non-existent.

fast forward a couple months back,i felt into the pit,feeling lower then ever so my coping mechanism was to drink.slowly but surely i stopped carrying about anything,quitting my job,and because i had so much free time now i began to drink even more,and it ended sooooo bad.....my last gf couldn't reach me by phone,which was unusual, so she had to leave early from work cuz she had a feeling so she came to my apartment and founded me passed on the floor,she called the ambulance,but i was already in a coma.i woke up in the hospital some days later.after a week from being externated from the hospital my dear,dear gf broke up with me,who could blame her after i did to her,i'm just a piece of shit.and now i'm here,no friends,no family,no gf,almost broke.what should a person like me do?maybe pieces of shit like me shouldn't be alive.

"i think this might be last thing i typei was born in extreme poverty. how extreme? at point of time , my father and his siblings had to gather wheat grains fallen while transporting them for food. but when i was born , my father was working hard to give me two times a day food with help of my mother.

growing up i was a unruly boy. i was all over place. screaming &amp; attacking etc doing all crazy sort of things. because of lack of education, my parents didn't knew any better nor they could afford any of my medical expenses. since they thought i was just being general asshole , they started punishing me physically. my mother has put powdered chilly in my eyes and throat countless times this continued until 13 . on other side,  my school started to get more shitty , as there were lots of bullies that bullied me. at age of 15 , i tried to commit suicide, i tried to jump off of my school building. also what contributed is death of paternal grandparents , my maternal grandfather and my paternal uncle. they were really close to me, and until that point they were the only people that  gave me nice things like toys , a $1 toy was fortune for me.

later, well into adulthood, i found out that i have adhd , and because of my past, i have sever depression, anxiety &amp; ptsd.

but my father and mother worked hard none the less and put me and my younger brother through engineering college ( i took 10 years for 4 years school). now i work as engineer, and because all of mental issues, i have no one.but i had friend tho , she went through bad child hood experience has child hood as i did. she lives half way across the world. i used to talk to her daily. but she is now busy in school and word and don't have time to talk to me.

now , i am 30 . i   have no friends , i live in decent house but no one is here except me . i have no one that loves me anymore . i don't talk to anyone. i go to work 9 come back at 6, and that is it. i have no one who loves me anymore , no one. and because of my anxiety i can't get into dating scene 

i have long thought about this over several times , i keep asking myself a question what i have to give to this world. i have nothing, nothing.

so yesterday , i got some potassium cyanide from work. i might try to off myself in couple of days. i have taken sick leave for couple of days . i might take it some point in couple of days.

been to a therapist but was just sent to a hospital and doped up for a week before being sent back home. shit ain't fun and i don't wanna deal with that again. i've spoken to family but by now they only make empty plans and ignore it. i've been called selfish for my thoughts and that hurts- the only thing keeping me here is the fear of hurting them. i don't fear death, i just fear hurting them.

&gt; they don't even happen intentionally anymore. i've had them for years but i just slip into them unintentionally even more now. its these almost vivid daydreams of just how i would kill myself, who would be there, who would see it, everyone's reactions, a detailed plan of how and sometimes when. these don't bother me, they never did. i'm not really scared to kill myself so fear isn't really the cause.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i keep having dreams about my old friends i don’t know why this keeps happening but here are my two most memorable ones. in my first dream, i was walking down the hallway of my school and i notice one of my old friends. i stopped and said hi in disbelief. we started walking together and then i see another of my friends. this happens a couple more times until we’re all just one big entourage. what’s weird is that my brain managed to picture them as if they were in high school  and i have no idea how it did that considering i haven’t seen them since 6th grade. it was honestly one of my happiest dreams. the second one is pretty consistent. it’s usually about this one girl who i think had a crush on me and i probably had a crush on her and she moved to my school. my dream would always be me trying to talk to her or get her attention to see if she remembers me, but i’m always too shy to say something. 

thanks for reading if you actually did. i’m assuming these dreams mean i actually miss my old friends and i regret not keeping in contact with any of them. so i guess the moral of the story is to not let go of the people you care about. thank you for listening to my ted talk.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"how do i deal with it?right now i’m just staring at the clock, anxious because of work. i’m relative average at my job. i make a lot of mistakes and hate when i do. why am i always thinking about negative things, why can’t i be happy and deal with it. every time i know i have work the day after i feel like throwing up. why is it that i’m so mentally unstable. nothing is really wrong, but i feel like everything is wrong. bad things are going to happen. it’s going to be a shitty day. i can’t stop with the negative thoughts. i just want to die. i just want the world to end. fuck man. i can’t control my emotions either. something is really wrong with me. i’m probably going to commit suicide for no real reason at this point. i’m useless, my family probably will be thinking i’m selfish if i’d killed myself. i just can’t stop it. it just hurts. i wish the world would just end. please just end.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i’m struggling to hold it together yet againi posted here a few months back and things thankfully improved somewhat. but i feel like i’ve taken 10 steps back once again. 

i was so amped up for the holidays. i hadn’t celebrated christmas since 2018 and was excited. christmas eve i had so much fun with my mom and my boyfriend. christmas morning was alright. 

but after opening the gifts with my boyfriend, my head just went south. i went to lay down and didn’t get up for hours. it’s like all my energy and what christmas spirit i had just plummeted. i thought it would be a happy turning point for 2020 but it’s like my head just decided, “no. be sad. you know this isn’t what you wanted. you know it’s just another day. you know nothing matters anyway.” 

the day after i held it together reasonably well to spend the day after christmas with my boyfriend and his family, but i felt miserable and sad inside. i don’t know them very well and the entire time i was a quiet, anxious mess. truthfully, i didn’t want to go. i didn’t feel ready to meet my boyfriends sister and her fiancé. i felt like staying home and crying but i didn’t. we had fun playing a card game. but then that night i was back home and felt just overwhelmingly sad again. i refused sex because i clearly can’t be in the mood when depressed as hell. on sunday after i worked my morning shift for a cal center from home and my boyfriend went home, i spent all night crying. 

my birthday is saturday and i feel directionless. i’ll be 26 and feel like i’ve accomplished so little. i feel like i can’t get away because of my personal responsibilities to my pets but wish i could just be alone for a few days. but at the same time i truly believe if i were alone for too long lately, i’d finally commit. most days lately i feel like the only things keeping me tethered here are the fact my mom would be devastated and my boyfriend of almost 1 year would be sad for a while. i feel like my head is constantly under water and i can never make any momentum in life without being thrown 10 steps backward. i wish i could be on antidepressants again but i’ll be losing my insurance on my birthday as that’s the cutoff for being on my moms, who was generous enough to put me back on it when i lost my job due to covid in march. 

i simply don’t know what to do anymore and wish i could just end it all. i know of/when covid is gone my life will never be the same. i cant handle how socially isolated i am lately and continue going back and forth between missing my friends amd people terribly and wishing i could surround myself with people again to just wanting to be alone. craving being alone. wishing more than anything that i could self-isolate and give up my responsibilities and not have to speak to anyone.

"cold, lonely and unfortunately sober. who cares. i will not be defeated!so i thought for some reason when i decided not to jump and drove home that somehow life would be different. like when i entered the state lines, everyone would suddenly remember how awesome i am and i'd be working out regularly by now. 

oh, guess what? it still sucks. everything is still a mess, everything reminds me of my abusive ex, i'm in withdrawal, haven't left the house (which is oddly cold, i don't know why), and i can't drink. 

no one's inviting me out suddenly. personal representatives from ikea have not shown up to organize the dumpster that is my room. i'm still sleeping on a mattress in the house of my friend who has no clue what's going on, but knows enough not to invite me out with him because i'm wacked out of my skull right now.

but fuck it. i'm safe. i've been living with a death sentence over my head for weeks. there is nothing having been on your own personal death row. stuck in a hotel room, drunk, so alone.. so fucking alone, rehearsing over and over jumping, imagining what it will be like, wishing it could be more peaceful. i didn't want to die, just wanted life to be a tiny bit easier. just not be tormented and so ashamed of myself. 

i don't know if it's going to get better, ya know? life has not been so kind and i have no idea how people do basic things. but if i'm going to die, why not just take some risks?

i know exercise helps. i know friends help. getting out of oneself. i know drinking does not help. i didn't have any alcohol today, so i might be in a little withdrawal. so effin lonely, but not feeling like i'm going to die soon is something. 

i fucking hate resolutions, but one thing is that i just want to keep trying and not let people get me down. andrew solomon called depression ""a disease of loneliness,"" so unfortunately i'm going to have to leave my cave at some point and face them: judgmental, duplicitous, manipulative, shallow, materialistic humans. i will have to tease a few people who aren't total shits out of this morass. 

i do know that self-esteem is key. i'll have to start small. just staying sober and exercising will probably be a good start.

"the loneliness is killing me slowlythrowaway because i don’t want to be exposed to people who know my handle.

for the last 5 years, i’ve worked two jobs with 50+ hours a week. a lot of days were double shifts. i’d start at 3am and get off at 4pm. i only had one day off a week.i didn’t have a lot of time to hangout with friends. my boyfriend (now fiancé) and i barely had time for our relationship. i was exhausted and felt lonely.

i wanted to hangout with friends. i wanted to go on date nights with my boyfriend. i wanted to play my favorite video game all day or get lost in my favorite book. i had dreamed of having enough time to dedicate to following my dream of becoming a photographer. but, my life revolves around work and i literally did not have enough time in the day.

since covid hit, a lot of things have changed. i lost my full time job (the money maker) and my hours were reduced at my second job. i have never had this much free time in my 31 years of life. i did get to play my favorite video games all day. i did get to pick up a book and get lost in the story. i even picked up my camera, started a website and began my photography journey - which has been doing well. but, i feel more lonely than i did when i didn’t have enough time in the day. and i don’t know why. 

maybe it’s the break in my daily routine that’s taking a toll on me. maybe it’s the fact that even though i have a lot of extra time, there’s nothing to really do social wise since covid has everything on lockdown. i’m the sort of person that needs consistency in their life and i don’t have it at this point in time.

i thought i would be happy to have free time. but it has made even the simplest of tasks hard to overcome. it’s hard to get out of bed in the morning. my favorite games and reading do not spark joy. it is hard to exist right now. when my fiancé and i go to bed i have never felt more lonely. i feel as if there’s a weight on my shoulders and it’s holding me down every day.

i apologize in advance for the long post 

it started in 2017 my freshman year of college i had to drop out because i couldn’t adjust to being at a major university not making friends and dealing with college level work. i had a mental breakdown and had to see a therapist and physiatrist i was put on zoloft and another medicine i can’t remember. 

that was december of 2017 for the first few months of 2018 i was a shut in i didn’t do anything but stay in bed. i found my dads gun but i was too scared to do anything with it. i was scared it would misfire and hurt me and not kill me. 

eventually i began to interact more with friend that were home they didn’t go off to school they stayed at community college and then planned on going to university. i began to hang with them like old times during high school and got confidence in myself again. i started working out on a regular basis again and felt good. 

throughout the summer of 2018 i was making friends and partying staying out late and not taking the medicine prescribed to me because i felt good without it. i was smoking weed heavily and ended up losing my virginity while high to a girl i didn’t even know on some random day. this started a whole downward slope. 

my car began to have issues because i was hanging out with a lot of girls i was considered a “fuckboy” and the one girl that i had gotten my first kiss from wouldn’t date me because of that reason and because her dad is racist. i began owing people money and couldn’t pay them back because i lost my job. i was high one day while my friends were playing basketball and decided to take my friends keys and drive to get something to eat without telling him. i posted a girls nudes in our friend group message which led to me being kicked out. 

while all of this was happening i was being recruited to the navy. i had stopped smoking to join but i was losing a lot of friends. my parents caught me smoking and sent me to a mental hospital. it was around the time mac miller died. 

late 2018 i was still feeling good because i had something to look forward to, joining the navy. but soon the thoughts of depression came back after failed hookup attempts with girls. i have to this day never had a actual girlfriend. 

i joined the navy in early 2019 and made it to the last few weeks of boot camp. where then i failed the fitness test by not keeping my pace running i was sent back in training. which meant i had to do another 4 weeks on top of the 7 i had already been there. this took a toll on me. 

i became delusional and because of unfortunate circumstances on the base i was sent to another group. the group was for health reasons related to a person who died and they wanted all the people with this condition to stay there until cleared to return. all this group did was complain which bothered me even more. i had a breakdown and was sent to a physiatrist to be separated from the navy. 

i was still delusional and thought i was going to be in the navy i ended up getting sent to the mental hospital where i spent 2 months before going home. when i came home it was the summer of 2019 i saw a new physiatrist and it took me a few weeks to realize i wasn’t going back to the navy. 

when i realized that i began to spiral i began to constantly eat fast food i stopped working out i got fired after 3 months at my job. throughout 2020 i’ve gained a lot of weight my hair has began to thin and fall out. i’ve began to think about suicide. i just have had enough i don’t have the ability to feel better i have no friends no relationship to look to.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"when your mother is the reason for your suicide plans.i don't know where to start or how to organize what i'll write so there might not be a linear line in this text.  

i have one little brother and one sister. as the children of the family, we have been severely abused. both psychologically and physically(now that we are grown no more beatings).  i am 22, my sis is 20, and the little one is just 10 years old.

now the main issue of the household, our parents. i cannot even begin to explain the situation we're in because lately it's become so intense i can't even organize my own thoughts. and always being depressed and suicidal does not help. but i do know that what i feel and what i think are caused by my parents, mainly by my mom. anyway, i'll try to hint some things.

she is 44, really a simple woman, grew up in a village until the age of 15-16 and moved to the city while still young. and bam, she married at 20. now, the man she married is no different from her, but he is absent every day and comes home late at night so we don't speak that much. this makes life a little easier, but the hate they have for each other spread through us. 

for our financial situation, i can't say we are poor but let me give an example. i recently went through a rhinoplasty operation(i needed it, believe me). i didn't know we could afford it because it is expensive to anyone in this country really. but when my mom, surprisingly accepted the idea and we fixed my nose. so, what's the catch? my mom helped me right? not so fast. little did i know that she never had the money. she took a nasty, nasty loan from the  bank without speaking to anyone. literally the  only person knows this is me other than her. hell, if pups learn it they would fight like crazy. now let's have a look at this situation. obviously this makes me feel like absolute shit. knowing that we are in crazy debt and thinking i am the responsible here. 

now let's talk about my brother, because hell, i care about him more than i care about anything. 

he might be the brightest child i've ever seen, he is kind, reasonable, and he works his ass off to manage the expectations of his abusive parents, and  he puts up with mom's yelling and shouting. most of the time she use bad words while speaking to him. so i can see his confidence is vanishing day by day.  just before i decided to type this, something happened. 

his online class was just finished, mom went and sit by him. all of a sudden started to shout like ""how can you not know this, how can you embarrass me like that."" this was too painful for me to listen because i went through the same as a child. so, i went into the room and asked her to stop. she then said ""make me."" 

now, the absolute absurdity of this situation makes me want to throw up. but given the excess amount of events similar to this and maybe worse, makes the situation quite normal for my family. 

for my medical condition, i haven't been diagnosed with something really. at least psychologically, but i do feel like shit, and i do want to be dead most of the time. i know this piece of text is literally shit too because i can't think straight anymore.

anyway, i have memories from all my childhood. and i don't know how it sounds but i feel like there isn't any good memory in them. i can't and will not kill myself because i want to have good memories with my brother and i want to have a good life. i believe after i've finished college and start working as an academic i'll have a good life. i have hope.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"accept a sad existence, or die?ive had depression for about 7 years, and after going into therapy i've come to a conclusion that i have to either change my point of view to accept a life of mediocrity, or die. i want to try to find a better way to look at things, but any advice i've been given just points me to adopt a blindly blissful view of the world in which i just accept that nothing i do will ever be perfect or will matter. 

i've spent the last year or so just trying to forget my existential thoughts by drowning myself in extra curricular activities and video games, but it always returns to haunt me, so i've decided to ask here what i can do about it.

"i'm going to kill myself.i need someone to see this. i've always wanted to leave this world, having left some sort of positive mark, but i would like to say that i feel too much emotional pain/scarring to justify having to live another second.

&amp;#x200b;

i get it, no one chooses to be here and that life is so rare that we should make the most of it because (to our knowledge) we only get one chance at life. i really get it. but if we can't choose our birth i feel that we should at least choose the time and date for our death.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm completely hopeless, lonely, and tired. maybe i haven't tried everything to feel even an ounce of happiness, but i'm so tired of this immense emotional pain i feel constantly. seriously, i wish there was a way i could convey to someone how it feels; except that i wouldn't wish this pain on even my worst enemy.

&amp;#x200b;

i have no emotional support in my life. didn't grow up with a dad. practically grew up without a mom. the rest of my relatives lived across the ocean. at 14, i got the worse advice i've ever heard: ""be your own parent"". i was so desperate for some sort of feeling of family that i followed it anyway -- it screwed me up and only drove a bigger rift between my mom and dad. it shaped who i am today. and i don't like who i am. just thinking about who i am right now disgusts the flying fuck out of me. you don't understand.

&amp;#x200b;

i tried changing it. i saw a reddit comment once about how people should try to have a sense of being genuine, kind and having integrity; and i wanted to follow that. that was the type of person i really respected and wanted to follow. i've been trying. every single day for almost 6 months now. i try to be what i want to see in the world. 

&amp;#x200b;

and yet i still have no substantial friends. no ""family"". no one to fall back on. two of the people that actually gave a shit about me got pushed away because of my depression. its too much.

&amp;#x200b;

i've tried most things at this point. therapy, sleeping better, eating better, just in general taking better care of myself. i've listened to podcasts and ted talks on mental health. i've read books on ""emotional bandaging"". 

&amp;#x200b;

like i put in a real, solid effort.

&amp;#x200b;

but for a while now i've just felt like if i didn't exist, it would be so much better. it would help my mom, so that she wouldn't have to pay for my college anymore (which she lords over me every single day btw like i get it you could take away the money at anytime but fyi that doesnt help me feel good like why did you even offer to pay in the first place if this is what you were planning to do). she told me today that she could pay off her mortgage, give it to someone else because she **knows** they'll use it better, or use it to travel. gee thanks i already feel like a disgusting piece of shit, thanks for reaffirming that i am. 

&amp;#x200b;

then somehow it became about how i was so disrespectful to her in high school and i tried explaining why (5 years of emotional abuse made me lose respect for her as a parent causing me not to communicate with her at all. we were like roommates that didn't talk during that time.) like yeah i get it,you didn't have a son, i'm sorry. but i didn't have a mom. you gave me all the material affection like food, clothes and a roof. and yeah my situation could be so much worse. but i would trade for a worse circumstance for a more loving mother. any time i was emotionally hurt she would just give me advice or cut me off because she had no patience to hear what i had to say.

&amp;#x200b;

i tried explaining to her how it was for me. i know how it was for her. but i don't think she understands or even wants to understand how it was like for me.

&amp;#x200b;

i have no one to send this to. i wish i did. i wish i had someone i could send this to and they would come pick me up and talk to me. i wish we could drive to the mountains where the road is windy and listen to some chill lo-fi trap or some other millennial shit. i want a friend who cares. i think that would give me at least an ounce of hope to live.

&amp;#x200b;

i want to feel that comfort. but i don't have anyone like that. for a long while now. it sucks feeling alone, feeling these feelings, and having no one to share it with. i get it, it's a lot of emotional baggage -- and i have a lot. but it would really help.

&amp;#x200b;

im so sad lol. im crying as i type this. i'm so hopeless.

&amp;#x200b;

fighting with my mom was what triggered me. i wish it wasn't. but i'm done. i've had enough. sorry for the long post. thanks for reading it, if you did. knowing that someone read a piece of my story is enough for me to move on.

"failed suicide attemptalmost a full month ago, everything had just become too much for me to handle. schoolwork was piling up, my self esteem was at an all time low, and i just really didn't feel like living anymore. i tried to slit it vertically but i was too squeamish and afraid of the pain. i had no rope to hang myself or any idea of where i could hang from. so i settled with taking melatonin and taking a bath with the water up to my chin, hoping i'd slump down, drown and die in my sleep. i know it sounds stupid (and it was). i left a note for each person i loved and just a general note for police or whoever found my body. i did end up falling asleep but i didn't die. my mom had come home and woken me up and was demanding to know what i was trying to do. i told her basically everything about how i wanted to die and how i felt trapped. she just yelled at me and called me selfish and how i was ungrateful for the life i had. she told my dad and i got yelled at again by him. i think she told my grandparents as well. my parents took away my phone until now and when they gave it back they told me i better not pull a stunt like that again or else my punishment would be worse. i can't help but wish i had died that day. i feel worse than i did before and i don't know what to do. i'm scared of failing again but i don't want to be alive anymore.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"41 and ready to goi do not matter. no one really cares if i exist or not. i am the kind of person that gets ignored in parties and no one would ever talk to. the few times i tried to take part in volunteer work or group activities resulted in awkward and embarrassment. people just ignored me even when i put up a brave front to interact with people. it may be easier for you to visualize when i tell you i am an asian living in a very white part of america. 

after spending the last 41 years in misery, i don’t know how to keep going. i notice that many people here are very young, am i the odd one out?

i am all alone with no friends, no partner and the only person who cares about me is my mum and she’s 9000 miles away. the one time i tried to settle down, i end up with a house that is a money pit and a shithole i can’t get rid of. i am not good at my job and i constantly fear of getting laid off. then again, i think maybe that’s good as it will finally push me to end it all. 

i don’t really want to kill myself as i am scared of the pain, but how do you go on when life has no meaning at all? i can’t find a reason for me to keep consuming resources in this overpopulated world.

how does one find meaning? i have been through therapy and it’s all the same cliche. i am not thinking positive, i am selfish and i am not doing enough to improve.

but now i'm cornered. i don't have any friends or back up, i don't have anyone to talk to. i'm in between general practitioners, if i tell my new doctor about my thoughts they might stop prescribing my pain medication due to instability or simply not take me as a patient. i'm out of options.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"im ashamed of who i amwhen i was 18 i became truly depressed for the first time. i went to public school and finished grade 12 and had a part time job. i realized life can be hard and i would need to learn how to get up when i fall but i nothing could prepare me for the state of mind i ended up in. the way people can be towards each other and the structure of western society did not appeal to me. my experiences with my peers in school and with adults like my parents and teachers made me miserable. i dint want to grow up and do all these things that are expected of me i didnt want any of it. i took my bike one night and rode down to the part of town where theres lots of homeless and drug users and i founds some one to buy me a 26oz of rum from the liquor store, i then rode back across town to my favorite place near a river. i drank that bottle and and tryed to open up my wrist enough to bleed out but i just ended up passing out from the drink and the pain and lots of crying beforehand. the next day was a very hot day in mid summer and the sun was high so it was about 12:00. i was soo dehydrated i could barely move, the sun had been cooking me out in the open for hours and if i didnt have the river so close i'm pretty sure i would have died from dehydration and a minor amount of blood loss. later on i tried to get back on my bike to go home and made it back to a road when i lost conciseness for a moment and feel into a ditch on the side of the road filled with black berry's but someone driving up the road saw me fall in and managed to pull me out. my family was devastated to learn what i had done i was rushed to a hospital as soon as i got home because the police where already there talking to my parents. i spent the rest of the day in the hospital vomiting up river water and talking blood samples. that was 10 years ago now, last night i lost my drivers licence for the third and probably final time , this pretty much destroys my future career plans and what little self esteem i had. my life feels like a nightmare, everything i wanted to avoid by killing myself when i was 18  has happend and its worse then i had imagined even when things have been going good theres a piece of me missing and i cant be happy, i shut myself off from the world , no friends , no girl, no idea how to be happy.. theres something clearly wrong here, im a good looking well mannerd young man with a family that loves and supports me i have way more to live for them most and im clearly a ungratefull peice of shit , i dont deserve my family ive caused them soo much pain over the years and the thought of hurting them more is the only thing thats been stoping me from another attempt.. i dont  think im going to make it anymore , i cant be the man i want to be i cant even take care of myself anymore.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i tried to kill myself but failed because i was too scaredi was up all night contemplating on doing it. i was so close to just fall asleep but my mind just became determined to do it. i got a hose and got in the car. i must have sat in there for 10 minutes wondering if i should do this. eventually i turned on the engine and i could smell the fumes coming in. it must've been about 30 seconds but those were the longest 30 seconds of my life. i was shaking the whole time thinking that this is finally it. my heart felt so heavy and breathing was very constricted. i turned off the engine cause i was too scared. then i laid down in the backseat for about an hour. my lungs kinda hurt but i was just too tired to do anything. when i went back inside to my room i just wanted to sleep. i didn't think too much about what happened. i didn't cry. i laid down on my bed and i felt strangely calm. then i fell asleep.,suicide,suicide,1.0

"stuck in an existence i wish never came to be in the first placei came from a high school in silicon valley, where my classmates were killing themselves left and right.
i've felt strong urges periodically but never did anything about them.

i decided to go all in on life, to pour everything i had in it in the hope that it would get better in time. in time the pain would go away and i would be happy.

when the pain lingered i kept telling myself the same thing: 'just wait another year. life can change so quickly, in a year your life will be way different. you might look back on this time a year from now shocked that you thought about suicide because life is so good for you now.' that change has never come. sure my life has changed, but my desire to live has not. to make things even worse, i achieved a ton in the past several years, and i feel worse than ever. i accomplished several things that i thought would make me happy, would finally kick me out of the rut i was in. but the rut persists.

many times since i first had a strong urge to kill myself seven years ago, including tonight, i've looked back on my life and realized that i should have just killed myself back then. nothing got better, and to make matters worse, i made several other people's lives worse. i broke the hearts of three girlfriends, i left them and wrecked their lives for some time. they would not have gone through that pain if it wasn't for me.

i sincerely want to kill myself, but i won't because of what it would do to my family. i wish, so strongly sometimes, that i had never existed in the first place. the world would genuinely be a better place without me. so much fucking better. i'm stuck and i don't know what to do. stuck in an existence i wish never came to be in the first place.",suicide,suicide,1.0

since i feel so safe with them, i take everything out on them. it’s usually just minor snarky comments and eye-rolls that i make when i’m feeling irritable, despite them having done nothing wrong. but sometimes it’s full-on yelling. don’t get me wrong - they’re not saints - they yell at me out of nowhere too, but i feel like that’s more justified since they have authority. i don’t know. i always try to apologise to them afterwards but apologising doesn’t undo anything. i often wonder if they ever regret having me. i wonder if they wish they’d skipped right to my brother instead. 

if i killed myself, i’d be ruining their lives. fucking up one last thing that echoes forever. but then again, they wouldn’t have to deal with me anymore.

"increasing thoughts about suicide (21m) after breakupin august last year i went through my first ltr breakup. it wasn't my first breakup, but i genuinely thought i'd marry this girl and it came out of nowhere. of course i was heartbroken, but i had a positive outlook that things would get better. so i pushed myself to go to the gym and diet (lost \~60lbs), started reading, pushed myself to reconnect with old friends and meet new ones, i got a job, began doing well at university, stopped drinking and became a generally better person. but as the months went on, the healing didn't seem to be going anywhere. i had taken all the advice and became a better person, but damn was i down. my anxiety began severely worsening and eventually i had to face the fact i was depressed when i saw a gp (i don't like self-diagnosing so i didn't label myself as depressed for like 8 months). '

i'm losing the motivation to keep pushing. i feel burnt out, but the pain is only intensifying. i honestly feel like i'm beginning to lose this internal battle and it honestly feels like i'll be forever alone. despite my best efforts, i only have one irl friend and a couple internet friends. to make it worse, my only irl friend is moving back to his home country in a couple months, so i'm going to have literally no one to hang out with, meaning i'll be alone with my thoughts. i went through 3 months of it before when i was stronger and it was hell, despite being busy and positive. 

its not like i want to kill myself. i've pushed myself past my limits and achieved amazing things. but fuck am i exhausted from waking up every day consumed by thoughts of my inadequacy and the fact that i'm alone. every morning is an internal battle to try and convince myself it'll get better. but i don't know if i believe it anymore. when i'm driving to work or college or the gym, i'll see a lamppost and i'll have the random impulse just to drive into it. or i'll have random thoughts about slitting my wrists in the bathtub. i don't know how much longer i can deal with everything. i feel like i may have a few months left of will power before i reach the year mark since the breakup and lose all hope. only thing keeping me going now is knowing my suicide would hurt my family, there's a possibility things may get better and my amazing dog.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i don't understand if i am really unreplaceable or if i do matter to othersi just got back from the birthday party of a girl i've had a close relationship for over a year, but i feel like i'm not good enough for her. i was with her at first but as more people arrived eventually she talked with other people, some of my friends came too but they were talking with others (there weren't more than 12 people there) so for the majority of the time i just sat there alone. for some time i have been thinking about no matter my effort to aproach the same people as those who went to the party i am eventually left out, they say they care for me and that i am a close person to them but i just don't feel like it is that way, for some time i have been feeling as if i can just be replaced after any given time and that there is no one person who would remember me if i was gone after a week or two.

i know this might sound like a dumb excuse or just me being overdramatic but i just don't believe i am worth anything to anyone not even myself.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"would distancing and neglecting close ones for a while before ending it ease the pain for them?i've had suicidal tendencies for a few months now. first occurring while i was going out with my girlfriend, and deepening ever since. since then, i've been dumped for being ""too good"" and felt alone inside ever since. after a chain of events, i realised that killing myself would be the best course of action; which i would have done earlier, but i kept thinking what kind of effect it would have on the people close to me. my ex-girlfriend told me about how horrible she felt when a friend of hers killed himself, and i honestly dont want to inflict that pain onto anyone else. i confessed to my ex how i want to do things i do, and she blamed it on herself for putting me in that position, her having attempted before, it was a very sensitive time. since then, i have stopped using social media the way i used to, giving close ones blunt replies and delayed responses to anger them and stray them away from me. while rejecting all invite to go out as it will only deepen my connection with people. my ex, who cares greatly for me still, i have been neglecting via text and call etc. making her think ive become a dick so she feels less when i do end it. my dad i havent talked to in about 4 years and my mother i rarely even converse with. maybe when i kill myself, hopefully, no one will feel anything.",suicide,suicide,1.0

fast forward this year, i still drink, but i know my limits,  i don't do drugs, and i quite vaping, but it still seems like that doesn't matter. whenever i drink i have coworkers telling me not to despite them drinking far more than me. my roommate was convinced that i started day drinking (i dont) despite whenever she's home in the morning she smokes weed in her room. i know people worry about me, and i have a few people i care for too, but that doesn't seem like enough. even when i'm with friends or when text people i always feel alone, and whenever i try moving on with life i get knocked down. i haven't tried killing myself because i dont see what that will accomplish, but also a bottle of sleeping pills mixed with some wine just sounds nice.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i am sick of tryingi really don't know why i bother anymore. my birthday was yesterday and it really just solidified the idea that i don't matter at all, not even a little bit. i always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since i've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. i put lots of money and effort into these parties. its not like i did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. i know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. i never ever did to my friends. and its not them its me. i dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should i even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. my mother could literally care less that i exist, she is coming home for christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. not a word about me or my sister. she knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. all i am good for is being used occasionally. i am not worth the air i breath. i just take up space and time that other people could be using. i am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it. i can tell people are disgusted by me, and im so sorry that they even have to look at me. i wish i would just disappear, people would only notice because i have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.
my other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her. but no one cares about me, maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long, maybe because im disgusting and dont matter, maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me. the only thing that keeps me here is my pet, and i mean how sad is that. that the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. i just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. i know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing i dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. i want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. i know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. there is no help i can get, ive done it all. why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden i just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.",suicide,suicide,1.0

she’s in her kinda “emo” phase, and she has a great personality, other than the whole emo phase thing, and really i’m just waiting for her to grow out of it. i love who she is, but not how she’s acting, and i’m glad it’s just how she’s acting and not really who she is but when will this phase of hers end...

also, she is a bit crazy. she makes homicidal comments, and threats often, and seems a tad obsessive, and gets angry pretty easily, and when she does it lasts a long time, and she just shuts down. im pretty sure the homicidal shit is just part of the phase, and i hope to god it is, because if she truly is homicidal, i don’t know if i can be in a relationship with her. she’s pretty cute when she’s mad, but i just wish she would communicate when she is mad, because i am trying to put in effort despite my difficulty with showing emotion, and having emotion. it’s really hard when i don’t even know why she’s mad though. 

thirdly and finally; we don’t really get any chances to see each other outside of school and that is just a big dud on our relationship 

gonna sound cliche and cheesy, but really it’s a case of heart vs. brain. my brain is telling me to end it, she’s homicidal (hopefully not actually), emo/alt girls usually annoy the fuck out of me (seriously waiting for that phase
of her’s to end), and really i’m just not sure what is happening with our relationship. my logic tells me to break up with her, but i just can’t. i want to, but i really don’t want to. my heart is telling me not to, even though it defies literally all logic, and to be honest, shits weird. i’ve made a point of basing my entire life around logical decisions, and have basically killed my emotions. now i’m suddenly just unable to make the logical decision, and really it’s scary and confusing.

"feeling like i should've died 4 months ago - strange feelinghi,

so it seems like either i push through or believe my mind which flipped over 4 months ago. i seriously feel like since this has started that ive been destined to suicide.

so my mind is so unbelievably destructive and i am severely depressed, not that i dont want to do anything, rather cant imagine doing anything with these thoughts, more like intrusive feelings based on false beliefs.

basically i recovered from dpdr this year, everything is as it used to be except for my mind. it is so worn out because the 6 months of dp were too much i guess. it is so worn out that i could convince myself that i died when dp hit me in february. there is nothing worse than no symptoms but still irrational thinking. it recently hit me with massive bouts of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. it feels like i shouldnt be here anymore.

4 months ago i thought suicide was an absurd thing (for me) and even during dp suicide didnt even cross my mind one single time. but now it feels like my worst imaginations came true and it is just pure mental pain.

everything about future is triggering the hell out of me, i cant picture myself in the future anymore without thinking (maybe i might have killed myself by then?!), it is so difficult to even hold the place at university, but ive already decided that i'd drop out.

it all changed in july where i had ups and downs but in the beginning of august these intrusive bouts of suicidal thoughts (like i hit a threshold and the only way out would be suicide, because it felt so terribly painful, like i was destined to suicide) hit me out of the blue and i suddenly became paranoid of time and future... it is not that i dont want to live anymore but my mind doesnt. it is strange...:( so basically it felt like my mind decided: your life is over now. this feeling freaked me out and days have been a struggle since then because it seriously felt like there is no way out but suicide. since august everything triggers the feeling that i should be dead, even my hobby: drumming, music.

biggest trigger: sounds hilarious, but it is the date. it seems like i hit some kind of threshold in august, since then, time triggers these suicidal feelings, like i am supposed to not be here anymore. damn this is undescribable, even more than dpdr itself.

most strange thing: it feels like i should have died, some dark feeling which eats me and that i'd be destined to suicide! i have a really bad urge to feed in to these feelings even though i know id made it worse...

i really have no clue how to recover from this hell. it feels like the only reason i feel like that is because i have a strong belief that something has to die or that something is very wrong with my mind.

"how to be an abusive spouse and parent during a pandemicnote: this list is perennially a work in progress.

1. refuse to participate in raising or caring for your own child.

2. refuse to leave the house.  refuse to cook, clean, shop, do yard work, or even so much as to offer feedback or suggestions when your spouse is ordering groceries for you (which you also refuse to do).  refuse to eat what your spouse cooks for you, while also refusing to either cook for yourself or say what you *would* like for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  offer only criticism and attacks, never support or relief or even an indication of what you actually might want except “not that.”

3. steal food from your child’s plate while your child is trying to eat.

4. log in to work so infrequently and miss so many of your own deadlines that you get formally written up for it by your own company (of which you are a co-owner), while at the same time insisting that your employees should be required to physically report to the office ahead of the already-reckless schedule you insisted on.

5. berate your spouse for not having a job while providing no support and taking up no slack so your spouse can either look for one or realistically work at one, since daycares are still closed *and* you refuse to actually look after your own child *and* you won’t cook, clean, shop, or do yard work either.

6. constantly demand sex while also refusing to initiate it.  angrily swat your spouse away every time your spouse tries to initiate as well.  clumsily grab at your spouse’s crotch at 3:00 am and initiate some low-key spousal rape every couple weeks or so, and then berate your spouse for not violently resisting while half-asleep and unable to comprehend what was going on.  make your spouse responsible for managing and assuaging your performative guilt.

7. lock yourself in the bedroom when your own child wants to play with you and is bawling and pounding at the door, begging for your attention.  

8. statistically, odds are you will occasionally do something that is intended to benefit your child.  if and when that happens, write it down in the way that makes you look the most like a selfless martyr, then exaggerate it a couple steps more, then lord it over your spouse at literally any opportunity that you can. that one time you went grocery shopping in february 2019 and forgot your wallet, for instance, becomes “i did *all* the shopping in february, and it was so much that i had to make *two trips*!” 

9. whenever your spouse brings up your behavior and asks for specific changes or even help with just one thing, literally any one thing, berate your spouse for not going to that one specific therapist you keep pushing so very hard.  demand that your spouse change medication or doses (note: refuse to watch your own child if and when your spouse *does* make an appointment to discuss medication changes, and scream with inchoate rage if your spouse attempts to take your own child to the appointment with them since you can’t be arsed to parent).  never miss an opportunity to turn a request for *you* to change *your* behavior into a spiteful referendum on your spouse’s mental health.

10. take your own medication so infrequently and at such irregular doses that, on those days that you take *what* you’ve been prescribed at the *dosage* you’ve been prescribed it and at the *time* you’ve been told to take it, you feel nauseated and spend the whole day bedridden.  refuse to speak to your own doctor about any of this, and berate your spouse for ever daring to “interfere” with your medication in any way.

11. address as few problems, irritations, or conflicts in the moment as possible.  the best time to bring something up is approximately three weeks after the fact, while your spouse is in the middle of doing something wholly unrelated.  in order to compensate for the length of time since the original incident, increase your original rage and vitriol by fifteen percent, compounded daily (you should therefore be approximately 18 times as mad as when the thing that set you off originally happened, if you’ve waited the minimum 21 days).

12. stop showering.  stop bathing. stop shaving.  stop brushing your teeth.  stop wearing *clothes* most days, to the point where it’s more likely than not that you’ve done an employee’s performance review over zoom completely naked and with breath so bad *they* could smell it.  but least be sure to tell your spouse how *they’re* the “disgusting” one.

13. find new and creative ways to tell your spouse how fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, selfish, and mean you think they are.  don’t just say it either; anyone can just *call* their spouse a fat slob, so that won’t do.  you should be able to, in a completely darkened room, let your spouse know *exactly* which of their features you find disgusting without uttering a *single* word.  

14. for bonus points, you can then berate your spouse for taking any measures to rectify these supposed flaws, but this is not ideal in the long run because you never want to give your spouse any sort of path out.  the ideal follow-up to a “dark-room-disgust” maneuver is to simply roll over and start snoring.

15. if you don’t like how your spouse is loading the dishwasher (note: you do not do the dishes, ever), go ahead and grab the plate from your spouse’s hand and smash it on the floor.  shove your spouse against the wall and just scream.  if your own child is in the kitchen with the two of you while this is going on, you may speak to your own child in a wavering sing-song voice but under no circumstances should you remove your hands from your spouse’s throat while doing so. 

16. blame your “outburst” on your spouse’s perceived lack of medication.

17. refuse to add either your spouse or your own child to your better and cheaper insurance plan until after your spouse’s personal checking account is down to its last $40 from making cobra payments.  threaten to take that $40 as well when you finally do add them.

18. spend two entire months telling your spouse what a garbage person they are because you had to add them to your insurance, even (especially?) if it is cheaper than the cobra plan you made them bankrupt themselves on.

19. lie about having added either of them to your insurance, so that your spouse gets a very unpleasant surprise at the pediatrician’s office.  scream at your spouse for “wasting [your] time” calling you because you only gave them enough cash for the copay and not the full uninsured cost of a two-year physical and covid test.

20. refuse to add your spouse’s name to your personal checking account or open a joint account, even though *that* just happened.

21. when your spouse’s car breaks down, refuse to pay for repairs and demand that your spouse donate it to your favorite radio station instead.  

22. while still refusing to do any of the grocery shopping or take your child to any appointments or any activities, hide the keys to your car and prohibit all forms of food delivery services.  refuse to ever hand your spouse your checkbook, credit card, or atm card as well.  turn every routine grocery shopping trip into a high stakes planning, budgeting, and negotiation exercise where your spouse must figure out *exactly* how much it will cost to feed you all this week, spend an hour trying to convince you they numbers are legit, rebut and improvise around you finding lower prices ... *somewhere* (at a store across town or in another city, for instance), trust that you will either go to the atm or wire money when you actually say you will, and then try to salvage things when you give them less than half of that.  

23. don’t just tell your *spouse* how how fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, selfish, and mean you think they are.  tell *everyone* how how fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, selfish, and mean you think your spouse is.

24. denigrate your spouse’s emotions, concerns, health, and contributions to the family at every opportunity.  make sure to *loudly* tell everyone you talk to how much your spouse is “looking forward to napping” when and if daycares finally reopen.  say you “might allow” that, but that your spouse “really needs to find a job” so they can “pull [their] own weight again.”  do this even after your spouse asks you to stop and says why it bothers them.  *especially* after they ask you to stop.

25. is your spouse looking at their phone for any reason?  grab it!  read their emails.  read their texts.  grill them over their search history or why there isn’t one.  make them tell you what they were about to google, then google it “for” them and toss the phone at them and stomp away.  respond to emails and texts “for” them without their permission, then delete the threads and leave them guessing who even tried to contact them just now.

26. did i mention yelling?  because you should be yelling more.  yes, even more than that.  yes, really.  you should aim for 3-5 howls of primal fury every week.  you should scream so often and so violently and about *literally any damn thing* that your spouse has a panic attack and starts reflexively apologizing and bracing for another slap even if you just coughed.  

27. whenever your spouse does this, *that is also an excuse to yell*.  see numbers 9 and 14-16, above, for suggestions on what to scream at your spouse about.  above all else, as you ball your fists in white-knuckle fury and pin your spouse against the wall again, remember to blame them for being afraid of you.  as you close your hands around their throat and start shaking them, in full view of your child, say “i am not your enemy.”",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

"in a very dark place and wildly lonelyim a 20 year old male and in one of the darkest places i have ever been.  i have no friends, no one to hang out with or call or play video games with. virtually all i do, other than work, is sit in my room and listen to sad music.  i am depressed and do not find amusement in things that i used to.  i have had girls at work show interest in me and talk to me, but i feel like i always drive them away with my incredibly bland and monotone responses-- even though i am interested, i guess i am just not socialized.

i live with my parents and 2 siblings.  my siblings are no more than just housemates, i never talk to or interact with them-- they have completely different interests and i feel weird and awkward initiating stuff with them because we have never hung out or shared interests or got along well at all quite frankly.  i am not even on speaking terms with my mother.  she is so self-centered and the least empathetic person i have met.  i was supposed to go on vacation next week.  i have a diagnosed condition called paruresis, it is basically extreme bathroom shyness. i need to stop at more private, less busy bathrooms on roadtrips.  she asked my not to go-- because my accommodations would cause her stress and inconvenience. she has never understood this issue-- which has drastically affected my life and opportunities, and is the root of my depression and probably the reason i have no friends.  because i always stay in.  she constantly dismisses my diagnosed phobia/condition.  ""oh thats still an issue?""  ""just relax and pee, i dont understand why its so hard"". it infuriates me even typing it. 

anyways, i get off work every afternoon and go to my room, listen to the same sad, emo and depressing songs while i just think and suffer.  i sometimes have vivid visualizations of how i could just put myself out of my misery and loneliness.  sometimes they get gruesome and violent and involve others.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i need some help so my step sister (whose in the same grade and class as me) posted a very embarrassing thing on our class gc about some guy and i. i’m a very shy person it took my a long time to break out of my shell and now all that progress is ruined and i never want to open up to anyone ever again. after she posted the video i left the gc and asked her why she would do that and she kept saying “oh it was a joke” or “everyone’s taking it as a joke!” but should i think it’s a joke if everyone else is? she’s posted that without my knowing and my permission and after that all i did was ask her to respect that i want her to ask me but she laughed in my face. my stepdad confronted her and she said she was trying to understand what i was feeling but if she did she would have apologized and respected my boundaries, but she hasn’t. now my little sister and her are acting like it’s my fault i’m mad at her and that i’m in the wrong and honestly they’ve convinced me that i am. even though it’s only been three days the two nights after what happened i’ve been crying myself to sleep because of it, asking myself “why do i have to ruin everything?” they’re (my step and bio sister) are talking about me behind my back. i’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety and i’ve told them about it and how i’m very sensitive about people talking about me behind my back but they don’t care, they don’t care that they’re making me live my worse nightmare. i don’t want to go to school. i loved it at school because they had such a nice environment and i had friends there and now i don’t even want to step foot in there. the bad thing is is that she knows a lot of things about me that i wouldn’t tell anyone there because i had trusted her and opened up to her so i’m afraid that she’ll reveal those things too. it’s really hard for me to trust people because of events earlier in my life. the thing is i was definitely not in the right place before i met my step family but now i feel the exact same way, friendless and alone.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"not sure what to doi used to go to an ivy league school. last winter, i was having a really tough time and wanted to kill myself. i decided to ask for help. i didn't have much faith in the psychiatric process, but i was hoping that someone would be able to give me a reason to get up each day: a reason to do something rather than be nothing.

much to my surprise, after being put in a mental hospital, i was thrown out of school. i was sent home with a 2 week prescription for an antidepressant and told that i could reapply in the future. i reapplied for this current term and was rejected. apparently they think i need more time to recover (even though they didn't bother to talk to my doctor from home, or give me any warning that i might not be reaccepted until a week before the beginning of the fall semester).

sorry for the tedious background story, but i wanted to provide some context for my question. why should i keep trying; why should i try so hard to eke out an existence when pretty much every day is fucking miserable?

i've spent a long time in therapy; i've probably taken half a dozen different anti-depressants. the only times in my life where i've felt even the slightest hope for the future were the result of massive delusions as to what is possible/plausible. i've only ever felt slightly happy under the influence of terribly unrealistic dreams.
now i have no idea what to do. should i keep trying to go through the admissions process for my former college? should i find a new university that might accept me as a transfer? what should i do for the next couple of months? i probably should go out and find a job, but why? why should i go to all that effort? what exactly is the end goal i'm working towards?

"i feel so disappointed and humiliated. i just want it all to end.i share an apartment with liar *not his real name* for 2 years now. i was in a relationship with him, and when that didn't go right, i looked as him as my best friend. he was the closest person i had, and i felt like i always had someone to lean on.... domestic partnership, as you would. i invested a lot in him, giving him cheap accommodation.... who turned out to be screwing another girl in our house while i was in  hospital.

we were in a relationship, there were ups and there were downs, but generally, i was happy. he never hit me. he's never tried to steal my money. he's never really done anything except genuinely care for me during my emotional meltdowns. when we broke up, i was interested in getting better emotionally, and hopefully, one day, get back with him in the future.

as for the living arrangements, i paid 2/3 of rent, all the internet bills and electricity bills. i work hard to buy him expensive alcohol and gifts, things to spoil him. he did pay $100 for rent, and bought dinners while i bought lunch. every other month, i'd take him shopping for clothes. i took good care of the people who took care of me. when we broke up, i was having a depressive episode, so i went back into hospital.

the living arrangements led me to paying that much more than him since i had very specific house rules... i do not like girls in the house, he is not to bring home any girls (especially said girl, let's call her b) and he is not to throw parties in the apartment to be considerate for our neighbours.

after we've broken up, i have never increased his rent, and he's continued to reassure me that he's never broken the house rules, that no girls were over, and that i am safe (i needed this rule to feel that my house was in control and safe). i trusted him with this. after my discharge from my one-month-long stay in hospital, i went back to my country of origin in south east asia for a month. i came back in january for 3 weeks to work (for school fees, bills, rent) and i left again in february.

we still talked like normal, he'd still ask me for nudes, he'd still tell me i was the prettiest/sexiest. i thought it was going well, me taking a break for a year and finding myself once more, while he could enjoy being free from my emotional burden.

i flew back early to xxx from south east asia because during my time there, liar expressed he wanted a new phone as his friends had damaged his. so i went out of my way, helped him buy a phone for a lower price, and spent hours unlocking the phone. i did this all willingly because i thought he was taking good care of our apartment, and i genuinely care about him.

i came home midnight on 21st, and to my horror, b (girl 100% banned from my apartment) was in the lounge room watching tv. liar was stunned, and i was too shocked and hurt for words. liar drove b home instantly, but came downstairs where i was cooling off to 'stall', presumably so b can pack her things. liar assured this was a one time thing. he assured that they were not having sex, and they especially assured they were not dating. he said b has only been in the apartment 3 times, which i affirmed it was still 3 times too many.

next morning i found yellow underwear on the floor and a black top. i decided to find out for myself.. so i went through his facebook- which was where i fucked up. it turns out liar was living with me because there were ""no good options"" to move out.. other quotes like ""good news! she's working 7 days a week now so you can come over."" and ""i found out she's leaving on the 22nd.. wanna come over?""

i feel so used. i feel so stupid. i feel so disgusted. i feel so worthless. i overdosed on my tranquillisers yesterday but they sent me home today after observation. i thought this was the guy that wouldn't screw me over... i had so much trust in him. i trusted him with my money, my house, my emotional state... my life. and he did this to me. i've messaged b with screen shots of what he's said to me... and confessed that we've had unsafe sex while i was in hospital in hopes that she would get herself checked... and see for herself that he isn't being loyal with her... only to be labelled as a psycho.

i'm so sorry for the rant... but i can't get it out of my head and i feel like i'm going to down another bottle with alcohol soon. i'm so sorry for ranting.. i'm so sorry i wrote so much people probably don't even give a shit...

there is nothing i can do right. i met this girl in preschool, and we lost contact for years. i met her again in sixth grade, and she was absolutely incredible looking. i've been in love with her ever since. deeply, badly in love. 

so now i'm at the end of my freshman year, and despite us being old friends and her being a family friend, i finally worked up the confidence to approach her. i get her number, and talk to her for a week. we're making good progress. i ask her to come hang out with me and some mutual friends, and she agrees excitedly. then the other friends back out, and i send her a text asking if she'd like to do something just her and i. 

she said she was free both days that i offered to hang out with these two other mutual friends (both girls) and when i asked if she wanted to hang out alone, she said she might have to work those nights. i pushed her to give me more information, and said ""it's fine if you don't want to."" she said ""no no. i'll let you know:)""

i know this means no deep down inside, but i can't deal with it. here is a girl who was my world for years-- she likely just lied to me. 

she was only trying to not hurt my feelings, right? but at the same time, she hurt them so much more than if she had given me a straight no.

""jeez man, it's so stupid to think about killing yourself just because you got rejected by some girl. who cares, man!""

that's not really it. this just adds to my ""i can't do anything"" mindset that is only supported by more and more evidence every day.

"i wrote a suicide note because i wanted to get my thoughts out. i'm not in immediate danger thoto primarily my family, then my friends, and whomever else it may concern,

first of all, i'm sorry. i don't know exactly why i feel this way. i remember i told you, mamá, that i was an atheist when i was 13 or 14, and you got mad. you threatened i would go to hell. don't you realize that if i don't believe in religion then i can't, don't, believe in hell? i'm not scared of divine punishment or ceasing to exist. in fact, i thinking non-existence is preferable to immortality of the soul. 

anyway, i think reincarnation comes after this. but i don't think it will be my soul that is reincarnated. after death, i think that it's destroyed, so it's no more. consequently, why do i have to worry about after death? i won't exist to experience its choke or whatever it entails. i think reincarnation of my energy occurs. energy can't be destroyed, right? maybe it goes into a new life form.

but enough about after this life. what about in it? i think i believe, or want to believe, nothing matters. i can't help but feel an itching that i need to kill myself, in this life, and successively in all the lives after, in order to beat this ""game."" (that's why i am so unsure about the afterlife, i have several speculations on it.) to fully perish. 

you know i am cursed with this skin condition. i have to take medication everyday in order to function well. i despair at the thought i'll never be normal- the embarrassment, the discomfort, noone will ever fully understand. it alienated me in school and has left an ink blotch on me now, so that like an abuser i look back on those depressive middle school times and wish to go back to them in an odd way. 

because then i was consumed by my earthly woes. i was depressed and lived day to day. i didn't care for much. now, i don't think i'm depressed. but while i saw short-term then i see long-term now. it makes me hopeless and makes me think suicide is inevitable. i imagine the cool metal of the gun in my hand, sitting on the floor and feeling its weight before raising it to the side of my head. i want to know what comes after this life. i want to know the actual true meaning on our existence. what we imagine seems miniscule; we can actually never acquire the truth in this lifetime. why not speed up the discovery? if everything is meaningless. 

some despair at the pain they will cause their loved ones. somehow i am disconnected from this worry. i imagine that you won't actually experience pain, not because you don't care about me, but because everything will stop. i don't fully believe this though; it is just another murky suggestion. it is quite self-centered. but i don't think i am the center of the universe. i just think everything is fake somehow. after i die maybe nothing will truly exist, not because i died but for some other reason. 

hey, my reasoning isn't that great. but it's whatever. 

i love you.

"just got word i’m getting 0% disability for ptsd from the military since i did cocaine oncethe military has chosen to give me 0% disability for my ptsd and horrible sleep apnea since my discharge is categorized as dishonorable (even though i received an other than honorable discharge) after i had confessed to doing cocaine to one of my friends shortly after deployment and he snitched on me so he could join osi. 

i mean, what would you expect someone with ptsd to do after returning from deployment? doing cocaine once and confessing to it sounds like someone that needs help, not someone that needs to be kicked out and completely forgotten about.

"i want to die.if you're reading this you're gonna be a while. i have a lot to say. tl;dr although i've had this feeling for as long as i can remember, things were extra shitty from 2013-2016. i wanted to be dead because it would solve all my problems. even when things are good, i always fall back to the 'i want to stop existing' feeling.


i don't know when this feeling started and to me it has always been a part of me. i guess i didn't think much of it when i was pre-adolescent but since i was about 12 years 'till now (21), this thought has consumed me and is a part of who i am. i have never actively tried to kill myself, but only because i know it would be devastating to my close friends and family. suicide is a apparently a thing in my family and even though some deny it, it is a trend. a fad. one person kills himself and another is sure to follow. i don't want this for my family, but i also don't want to suffer for the rest of my life. i want to be selfish, but i can't. i've always cared too much about others.


from about 12-15 years i was generally just sad. i know how to seem happy and people would tell me how positive i was all the time. it felt good, but deep down i still felt awful. nothing bad really happened to me, i think it's just the cards i was given. i knew how to make time pass and i've had several hobbies growing up. although it's still not too late, i never went to a specialist. maybe i should have. i just didn't understand the problem and looking back now, i know i wouldn't have been able to explain it right. there's also the stigma and taboo element to it that made it easier to just hide it. 


i have a decent amount of friends and have been in two long-term relationships during 2013-2017. they were both good, broke up cause of unrelated issues, and i still talk a lot with my recent ex. we might try again when i get back home. the distance and a tight schedule is what broke us up. i think we can make it work. the point is, i have a good life. sure, there has been ups and downs, but my life is good. i've been in the military and i'm working on getting an education. i spend the excess time on myself and my hobbies, so i should feel happy. often i do. 


but it always falls back to that shitty feeling. there's always something, even when there's not. ""if i was dead right now, i wouldn't have to deal with this anymore"". i can be happy, i feel joy, but i don't like living. i think i may have some mental problems, but i don't want to self-diagnose, so unless i check it out it might be anything and nothing. i tried once, but either i didn't explain myself good enough or something else, cause i didn't feel like i was understood. things were going kind of good at that moment so i thought it might've gotten better. there were a couple of months where i didn't have this feeling that i wanted to die, but it didn't last. as i rose, the inevitable fall was just getting bigger and bigger. 


that's the thing. i'm content with feeling sad and awful because that is just another day, but periods where i feel good always ends up knocking me down again. that's the hard part. the happier i am, the harder it is to live with this. the thought that is always on my mind. i don't understand how it came to this. there's something seriously wrong with me, and it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. i want to be dead. i know i'll end up as a part of the statistics some day. just another number. 


it will crush my family and at least some of my friends. other people will maybe learn about it from an acquaintance or see a post about and then forget me in a few days. most will judge me for it, trying to be smart with the ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" and the ""selfishness"" of it. i fight every day, but i'm scared that someday it won't be enough. 


i know this sounds like some r/iamverysmart shit, but here we go. i consider myself well above average intelligent. i learn fast, understand complex things faster than a lot of my fellow students do, read a lot, good memory and so on. i speak two languages fluetnly, learning french now and also speak spanish at a decently advanced level. i don't see myself as superior to or better than anyone, but i think very much. too much. i feel like i could be a lot more useful with this, but i don't want to. i'm not really sure where i'm going with this, i'm just trying to come up with what can be relevant. not sure if it's true or something ""smart"" people said to feel better about themselves, but i remember reading something along the lines of ""people with a higher iq has a greater chance of committing suicide than those who don't"". in my hometown, the people i know of who killed themselves were 2 doctors, 1 lawyer, 1 fireman and 1 professor in physics.


i listen to a lot of music. many different genres. music is what gives me the most joy and that safe feeling. not gonna go into more detail, but music never fails to calm me down when i need it.  i also like traveling. after i finish my education, i might move to france. i love the french language and the culture. i have this romanticized idea that this will fix everything for a reason. it probably won't, but it just feels so right. 
so why do i still end up with this feeling at the end of the day? my life around me is more than good enough. i don't get it. but i want to be dead. i want to be gone. i just don't enjoy life. things can give me happiness, but the whole act of just living is so off putting. it sucks. i don't want to exist. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my teenage brother just attempted suicide. i need help on how best to support him. thanks for all advicehello everyone. my 16 year old brother just attempted suicide yesterday. luckily he's fine, unhurt, and back home now, but it's been a huge shock for the whole family. i live a few hours away but i will be driving over tomorrow to see him. he and i have always been a bit distant growing up, but we've always been friendly and rarely fought. 

in the meantime, i am trying to figure out the best way to express my support for him. i have a number of ideas in mind already, all of which are centered around how i will always love, support, and be there for him if he ever wants to talk. 

there was one thing i would like to say to him but im not sure if it would be an effective/acceptable thing to say. here it is:

""mom and dad love you so much and they would give you their kidneys if it meant you would be happy. losing you would ruin them.""

i feel like this is an effective statement because my brother loves our parents very very dearly. and this statement strongly represents my feelings on this too. however, another part of me thinks it sounds a bit rude in a way? i'm not sure, so i'd like to double check with you all. thank you so much for all input.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

"i don't know how much longer i can hold outthis is going to be a long wall of text, as the last 3 years have been some of the most painful and difficult of my life so far. 

back in 2017 i tried to hang myself. before that i would privately write about suicide, only to get confronted by my parents when they went through my journals. ""what the fuck is your problem?"" ""why would you do this to us?"" ""this is just attention seeking, so it's a real bitch move."" i had self-harmed for a bit as well, until my mother confronted me in front of my grandparents about it. ""you know, this is something [insert ex-girlfriend here] would have done, you're just being a bitch."" 
        
in the months leading up to the attempt, i finally realized that i had been depressed for years. i told my parents about how i was feeling, and they believed me for the first time. for years up to that point they would vehemently deny that i had any mental illnesses at all, even refusing to let doctors put me on medication after one diagnosed me with major depression. 

after the attempt, i was hoping i could just tell my closest friends and keep it secret from my parents. however, two weeks later i was forcibly committed to a psych ward by my psychologist at the time. i had seen her once beforehand, and immediately after i told her about my attempt she said ""i'm sorry but i can't let you leave unless you're going to a facility.""

so an hour later i'm being loaded into an ambulance, driven to a hospital to stay for the meantime (even though i had no injuries or anything from the attempt), and with a cop nonchalantly watching me from the door to the room. i had to call my parents and tell them what was happening, since i was on their insurance. when they show up, my mother hugged me then immediately tried to punch me in the stomach, gritting through her teeth ""don't ever do that again.""

i had to drop out of college, spend a month in a mental hospital, and then move back home with my parents while attending outpatient group therapy. the first morning that i was back, my mother immediately threatened me over a shower. ""if you use all the hot water, i'll end you myself."" that led into a 40 + minute heated discussion over text. where she not only admitted that she had read through all my texts and messages to my friends, but mocked me for talking to them about my depression. i ended the conversation with, ""i'm going to show everyone these messages so i can get the hell away from you."" 

at this point, my father calls and starts yelling at me about how i've been disrespectful and need to apologize. his only role in their marriage is to agree with her and ignore all the horrible things she says to me. at the end of the day i go home, my mother apologizes to me and i do the same. it's never brought up again, unless its to remind me that i'm a horrible son and an ungrateful piece of shit.

about one year later, i've regressed horribly. i've stopped going to therapy or seeing any mental health professional, i only take medication and self-medicate when i can with cannabis. in march 2018, i was confronted by my mother about buying pot, which turned into an argument. she screamed at me, ""you've disrespected this house!"" i shouted back, ""you've disrespected me for my whole life!"" then she charged at me, punching me then digging her nails into my arm. i hit her back, got her hands off of me then slapped her in the face. naturally, i called the police and they just kicked me out of the house. i walked three blocks, covered in sweat, blood, and tears with my belongings in a backpack. luckily, i had friends who lived in a nearby city that allowed me to move in with them. 

i had planned on never talking to my parents again, after one phone call with my father where he just continued to blame me and deny any fault of his own. my friends and i drove back down that same week to get the rest of my things from them. i gave them my phone (they paid for it) and car keys and told them never to talk to me again. 

a week later, my mother sent an email apologizing. i quickly deleted that email and did my best not to talk to her. but i had bigger problems. since i had to move so quickly, i also had to quit my previous job because they wouldn't authorize a transfer. i also had to move again, since my friend who had allowed me to live with him had to move himself in a couple months. i had another group of friends who would allow me to live with them, but they only had less than a month left on their lease as well. so i temporarily moved into their house, and i worked at a minimum wage job to try to raise money for an apartment. needless to say, that did not work out. since i was new to the job i was not getting consistent hours, and i had to call out sick my very first week since i got the flu. 

so i asked a friend for a loan of $500. he obliged, but that alone was not enough for an apartment. with no other options, i asked my parents for a loan of $1000. they agreed, if i could meet up with them in person. we did so at my job, they gave me the money, and i was finally able to afford a place to live. i knew they relished the fact that i couldn't do it on my own, and i honestly wonder if it would've been better just going homeless and dying right there.

four months later, i lost that job. i was seeing a therapist, trying my best to make ends meet, but i was constantly late to my job and emotionally volatile. i was using cannabis even more to cope. i would breakdown frequently at home, i started getting anxiety attacks and even got one at work while working the register. i knew that i had fucked up, and so i began searching for any other job that would take me, all the while having my parents pay for rent when i couldn't do it.

i found another job, paying a livable wage for full time work. i thought i'd finally made it work, i was able to live comfortably with friends that respected and cared about me. but six months later, i lost that job too. i started feeling so horrible that i couldn't get out of bed, i stopped caring about cleaning myself or my apartment, and i got myself into a horrible relationship with a manipulative alcoholic. thankfully, that only lasted about two months before i broke things off. 

but i found work once more, essentially being a furniture delivery and repos guy. it started paying decently, but i had no idea the work would be so intense. that, and the management genuinely did not care what happened to us. one time we had to deliver a couch to a fourth floor apartment at 1am with no elevator. we got yelled at and chewed out constantly, simply because they would overbook us then blame us for not being able to deliver eight furniture sets in one day. 

my first partner on the job lasted three months. before he left, i had requested vacation time about two months before hand. i was repeatedly told that i would not get it, and that i should just ""reschedule."" so one week before my vacation time i quit. sent the manager a text only and quit that same day. i blocked their number and refused to leave my apartment.

after my vacation, i spent the next three months wallowing in my misery. i didn't do anything productive, just smoked cannabis and laid around. i had no plans to get a job, as my parents had agreed to help me out with rent since they knew how awful my last job was. it wasn't until january 2020 that they started pushing me to get a job. 

that's when i got a message from my old job, they had a new manager (one of my previous colleagues) and he wanted me back with a raise. i agreed, and it took two months for things to spiral back down to the awful level they were at before. same problems, overbooking us and then offering no support whatsoever when things wouldn't work out. worse even, one of my colleagues was a horrible alcoholic. he always came into work smelling like liquor, and could barely lift anything. no matter how often i told my boss to get rid of him, he'd just say ""give me some time, man. we need someone to replace him."" unfortunately, they found no immediate replacement before he stopped showing up. 

by this point of the long, unending text, we've reached march 2020. the pandemic is just starting to hit my city, and i'm expecting my work to close. instead, they cut our hours in half and keep us open. but i'm still working there, because i'm planning on moving out of the city in two months. however, one day my mother literally begs me not to go back to work. says that she will help pay for rent, and recommends me to sign up for unemployment. 

that leads me to where i am now. i've just received my last unemployment check, and next month i need to search for a job. i'm very lucky that i'm living in a house full of close friends, for very cheap. however, i'm close to my parents' house so they know exactly where i live. i don't want to live off of them again, but i know that i'll probably have to. i'm lucky that i get all this financial support from them, but frankly i'd rather just be dead.

i know they're going to hold this over my head, like everything else. i know they're going to use this to try to keep me talking to them, but i know that i need to get away from them. i need to cut them off, for a multitude of legitimate reasons. but given my current financial situation, the situation of the pandemic, and my continuingly horrible mental state i have few other options.

i'm very lucky and thankful that i've gone so long without another suicide attempt. i've self-harmed, but i've had enough mental fortitude to keep going for this long. if i didn't have the caring, forgiving, best friends that i have, i'm sure i'd be dead. but i'm also not sure how long that alone can keep me together.

i recently threw out the knife i was cutting myself with, but i had no idea that would only worsen my general mood. i've been holing myself up in my room for over a week now. i leave occasionally to talk to my friends or smoke, and then come back. my sleep is inconsistent, and has had me waking up in the late night/early mornings, when everyone else is asleep. 

i have constant suicidal thoughts, or paranoid thoughts of my friends turning on me and throwing me out, or horrible intrusive anxiety that can halt whatever i'm doing and throw me into a constant thought loop of worrying, inevitably leading to an anxiety attack where i basically disassociate and come back to find myself curled into a ball while holding back tears. i'm so scared for myself and my friends, because as much as i hate what i've become, i hate the image of one of them walking into a room only to find a corpse. 

if you've read all the way through this, thank you. i haven't posted anything about my personal life before, and i felt like i needed to get all of this out somewhere. i hope everyone here makes it out of this alive. i don't know you, but i sincerely love you nonetheless.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i spoke a little bit of my ""old"" cocaine habits (i'm clean for 1,5 months now), to which he said ""yes, you're an addicted"". i replied harshly: ""what part of 'i stopped' didn't you get?"", to what he said ""even though you're not using the substance, your life is made by its effect: small, tasteful and intense bits of happiness, followed by a strong and last-long depression because of the recklessness. that's called hypomania. every person in the world wants to live on their hypomanias if it comes without the side effects. but the side effects are still there, even if you say to me that you don't care about them, and they stack and grow up"". i did not had an answer to that, and it made me reflexive.

after a while, he said ""well, if you want to recover, you need to want to recover. are you ready for that?"", which i replied ""sure, but i don't have will power for that"". he then said ""good thing you're not a child anymore and you don't have to be guided by your will, but by your needs. it's a fallacy that every human being depends on their will; instead, their will depends on them"". i got speechless again.


i never was so harshly beaten up. i mean, i try to racionalize everything and this guy still got me twice. maybe i respect him for doing that. he also didn't try and diagnose me as fast as he could; he said he got an opinion, but he'd only tell me with time. i did not feel understimated, but also respected.

he prescribed me some medicine, warning me that it would make it worst at first, but eventually and with time, i'd be recovered; ""there's still hope, you just don't see it"". 

i was closer to suicide than i thought, and today i didn't think about it. started a routine and tomorrow will do some exercise. things heal, i finally dared to see a light in the darkness. i'm almost crying of joy. 

nevertheless, i want opinions. there were some time i didn't get to a doctor, so it may be some kind of placebo; maybe tomorrow things will blur up again. am i overreacting, like cocaine-reacting, my consult?",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

i've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. at 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. i'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.
i had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. i had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from  the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. my depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. i think i'm out of my depth on this one. we were fuck buddies because i didn't want another relationship. i didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. 
she was moving for school and i couldn't bare the thought of losing her so i asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.
i've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. i think at this point if i self harm it'll be the end. i promised myself that long ago though i didn't follow through the last time i started cutting myself. this time i think i would, one  pump of adrenaline is all it would take then i wouldn't be hurt anymore. 
i left all my friends for her, i moved an hour away for her. i dont see a point in living, i dont see a point in eating or sleeping. 
i dont know what i'm expecting fro. this honestly, i have noone but my sister and i hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). i know how i'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what i need. i dont want to but i have nothing and noone. no friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. i've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than i can remember. usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.
i'm a burden on everyone. i think the world would be a better place. all i can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. 
relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. no friends, no family, noone to hurt if i die. i dont know what i was hoping to accomplish with this post but i think its pushed me farther towards doing it.

"if you want to die pls come here firstive been planning my suicide for a while. each time i break down the plan changes a little. today after crying my eyes out i filled out the application to get a permit to buy a gun. ive thought this method was too messy in the past but today i reached a new level of self hatred where it sounded pretty fitting. i feel like in not wired right. everything hurts. my life is good. i have loving parents. good supportive friends. a great sister whos a shinning role model. but i often end the day in tears. people say to stop and sount your blessings and its supposed to help but it only makes me more mad at myself. i have it so good and i still want to die. what is wrong with me. after i filling out the application for the gun i cried some more and then decided to call the suicide prevention hotline. i had a half assed conversation about antidepressants as i held back tears. i cant blame the guy. i was nervous and didnt know what to say so i asked him about them. i felt like i was talking to walmart customer service or something though. it didnt help. i felt even worse. here i am a 23 year old man crying to another grown man asking about drugs. i felt so stupid and ended the conversation with ""im sorry for wasting your time. thank you. goodbye."" and hung up before he had the chance to say anything else. i cried for a bit longer. i felt so stupid. i went online and looked for suicide chatrooms or something. just anything to talk to someone but not on the phone. i went through a bunch of articles about depression and suicide. but then i found one that got to me a bit. it talked about suicidal thoughts as the moment our pain begins to out weigh our methods for coping with pain. i dont know, im a very methodical/show me the facts type of guy and this way of looking at it just struck me in a way the other things hadnt and for while i stopped crying. i kept scrolling and eventually got to the comments section of the article and found a bunch of people saying how much they wanted to die and how bad they felt. i always feel like im not taken seriously. my situation is pretty good so when i have voiced how i feel to people in the past ive been dismissed and told to get over it because there are people who have it worse than me. i understand that this world is harsh and will kick you but i feel like dying when everything is ok. somethings just not right in my head or maybe somethings just not right in my life. but seeing those people talk about it really made me feel better because as cliche as it may sound i felt like i wasnt alone. i didnt feel so defective. there are people who understand what im feeling. that coupled with the perspective of the article really made me feel like i can change. something may be off with me or my life right now but i feel like we can get through it. im not gonna preach on the strength of the human spirit or anything like that but i just really believe in us. you and i just dont have the tools right now. i want you all to use this reddit to talk to each other and just relate and maybe share tips. the most potent help ive found has been in you all and your stories so i just want you to use this partially for you and partially for me. i think we can make it together. i feel so fucking corny.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm so fed up but i feel so guiltymy life isn't... bad.
i've been medically transitioning (mtf) for almost three years now. i've had a wonderful girlfriend for two and a half. i'm in college, i have a decent job so i don't have to worry about how i'm gonna pay my bills. i don't have so many of the problems others do.

but i've been emotionally and verbally abused by over a decade by my piece of shit stepdad and it's shattered my sense of self worth and self esteem and ever since i was a child he made me afraid to be a burden, to rely on people, to need things. he's made me afraid of loud sudden noises, of people shouting, of making mistakes. i've been depressed for over half my life and at least mildly suicidal for the vast majority of that time.

i've been chronically ill for a year and a half, i lost over a third of my body weight and it fucked up my heart. the problem is fixed as of a month or so ago but there's no way of knowing if i'll ever recover all that muscle, and even less so if my heart will ever recover.

the problem is... i still really want to just kill myself and be done with it. tonight's the worst night in a long time now, since the last time i attempted about 4 years ago. i know that i have all of this good in my life but i still just want to run, or die, or something. i'm at the point of running through all the different meds i have here in my head wondering if some combination will actually kill me and not just leave me with trashed organs. i feel horrible because i know that if i do it will hurt my girlfriend, and i'll be buried with the wrong name on my tombstone as well... but on the other hand it means that i'll be done with it all and i won't have to worry about if my friends actually hate me or cry over fears that i'll never be enough for the people i care about or hate myself or remember what it was like when my heart worked normally and miss the things i used to do.

besides, if i do it, at least she can be with someone better for her than i am. someone that can be with her as much as she deserves and not have to cancel plans because i don't have the energy or will to do it. and i won't have to worry about disappointing her, or my mother, or my asshole stepdad ever again afterward. just the one time, as opposed to a lifetime of being a disappointment.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my first post here.        so i am a 2 time cancer survivor at 14. no, i’m not kidding. when i was 12 in 2018, i was experiencing severe pain in my right hip along with high fevers. i saw doctors who said i was being lazy, or it was growing pains. i missed days of school because the pain was too much to handle. finally, after about 6 months of experiencing it i was scheduled an mri. i was diagnosed on october 26, 2018 at the age of 13. it turned out to be ewings’ sarcoma, a bone cancer common in teens and young adults. people say i should have been diagnosed sooner because i had every symptom and i was the exact type of person who would get it. i went through the chemo and radiation because surgery would be potentially fatal for me. i handled it decently well, and i definitely grew as a person in general. from shy and quiet to cheerful and talkative. i finished ewings’ treatment on august 26, 2019. i got my medals, t-shirt, rang the bell, and went back to normal life. it was great! everyone said i changed in a good way, and i was happy to have that boringness back! 
       then on december of 2019, i had my check up scans done to see if cancer was coming back. i was called back after christmas for some more scans because they saw something that wasn’t a result of past treatments. it turned out to be cancerous, and i had a biopsy done. they were expecting ewings’, but it was all leukemia. this was january 3 of 2020. they were surprised because there has not been a recorded case of someone having ewings’ then getting all leukemia. they were a little relieved, though, because all leukemia is one of the high survival rates cancer in children. i started chemo on january 8, 2020. i was lucky they caught it early because that meant that i didn’t have to stay in the hospital for a month. only two weeks! i found out that i needed a bone marrow transplant later due to the fact that my body was still very weak from prior treatment, and the fact that i had this as my secondary cancer. my leukemia wasn’t super hard to achieve remission, but the transplant would be the only sure way to get rid of everything completely. a body reset. leading up to the transplant, the hospital attempted more chemo on me. one two week stay in the hospital with angry kidneys and a deadly allergy attack from a chemo which landed me in the icu later, i was just put on a very small amount of chemo each week until transplant. 
            i went in for transplant on april 30, 2020. i had chemo plus radiation to kill of my old cells, and make room for new cells. i got my transplant on may 6, 2020 by 2 umbilical cords. i felt weird, but fine for the next week, then i got engraftment syndrome. it isn’t actually a medical illness, but it is what we call when you start showing signs of engraftment. you will know when you are engrafting because the pain is horrible! it also came with loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, and other fun stuff! i was on a morphine drip, and asked for benadryl every so often. i didn’t sleep for about 3 days straight. because of the coronavirus, i wasn’t allowed any visitors beside a select few hospital staff. thanks anti-maskers for making sure that 4 kids all under the age of 16 weren’t allowed to see their families during the worst part of their lives! i ended up being so mentally messed up that the unit was allowed to have a therapist come and visit instead of doing tele med. it was all worth it though because after 35 days in the hospital, i was allowed to leave cancer free! my muscles ached so badly though, i could only walk a few minutes at a time very slowly. transplant is such a surreal experience because you can feel everything that is going on in your body. pretty hard to describe. 
           i still had to stay in a hotel nearby the hospital because they want you close by in case if something happens. i only got one fever, which they still don’t know what caused it, and a few graft versus host rashes. i was doing so well that they let me go home early. after 92 days total, i got to sleep in my own bed for the first time! i still have to go to the hospital once a week for check ups. right now, i am got my ewing’s mri done which showed what they think is radiation scarring so i’m not too worried about it. the radiation oncologist said it did look like delayed scarring, and it was in the exact place where scarring would show up. i am also getting a lot of post 100 days transplant tests done at the moment. all of which with good results. 
        i posted this just to say enjoy the little moments. we all take stuff for granted, and i got it all swept away from me in an instant. i used to be able to jump, walk without a limp after exercise, spend time with friends, celebrate holidays, and go to school. i have been wearing masks since 2018, and now i have to when i go to the gym during slow hours. i am feeling a lot better physically and mentally than 4 months ago. i’ve completely changed as a person from 6th to 9th grade, and i’m grateful. not for the cancer, but what it made me. i met some of the best people in my life from doctors, nurses, and other patients. i have made some lifelong friendships. i was opened up to many opportunities that i never thought i would do before. i am actually a bit of a mentor now to kids that get recently diagnosed because i have so much experience. i have met kids who won’t live to be 20, and ones who passed in my treatment. i am just grateful that i got off lucky so many times so far. i see life in a new angle. we all live our own lives, and all feel differently. really the best thing to do for someone is understand them. stay safe, and enjoy yourself and those around you. if you like to hike, then hike. i you like to be alone, then be alone. just enjoy those happy moments. i don’t know how to share pictures on a post, but if i did it would most likely be my cancer medals. i hope you all can believe this, but i understand if you don’t.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

i got a second job as a busboy in a restaurant near my house. i can't stand that job. i also have had a long talk with my whole (immediate) family and my parents are getting a divorce. i want to leave my house so bad but my therapist said in the state i'm in it wouldn't be a good idea. i would leave in a suicidal state and have many unresolved issues with my family that can become bigger problems my future. 
i try to used comedy (like always) to make a joke or lighten the mood but really it's a shitty defense mechanism. so i go to work and fake a smile with all the people that walk through the door and i wave at the people i pass by on the sidewalk but i never feel more empty than when i do that. i wish i could just seep into the sheets on my bed. no worries about the future. no worries about money. or family. or suicide. or making anyone disappointed in me. no voice nagging me saying that you can do that better or that i'm a failure and what's the point in trying. 
i'm scared and right now the only thing i have to look forward too is having a session with my therapist friday. nothing more. no vacation. no holidays. no birthdays. no visits. no time for myself. i just want to sit down and wait to rot away.

"90 minutessome psychologists say that it only takes 90 minutes from the decision of commiting suicide to the act of commiting it, if it's longer you start regreting the decision.

i always thought that on those 90 minutes, the person itself could think properly and was in a vulnerable state of mind... but when you start experiencing those 90 minutes, your opinion changes.

i was one of those people that summarize all the suicidal people to ""people crazy that can't think straight"". i was wrong, very very much. i thought that suicidal people were one in a million, i was wrong again.
in my life i met people who had depression (the actual mental illness), some other that just felt bored of their lives, and other that wondered around the idea of suicide from time to time. and actually, i realize that i think about it very much.

what i'm trying to say with this? i don't really know, i just felt like i had to write something to calm myself down, to forget about my problems a bit, i could have written this on a paper a throw it away later, but i think that i could use this opportunity to apologize. because i want to say that i'm sorry for thinking that suicidal people were just ""crazy people"", i'm sorry for thinking that suicide thoughts were a sign of weakness.

"had a breakdown at college, returned home, feeling zero motivation to start overjust a heads up: this is really, really long. i'm worried there's too much exposition to actually belong on r/suicidewatch. if so i'm deeply sorry and please point me in a direction where this is better suited. i've never told anyone my full story or dealings with suicide and depression— at least, not the entire, whole truth. i was hoping this subreddit could listen.

so a bit of a backstory on me. i graduated from my high school with a 95 gpa. my whole life i was in  advanced classes, and always did my best. i took piano lessons, played soccer, took chinese lessons outside of school, held down a part-time job at a local farm, was a secretary for my school's computer club, and still managed to go out with friends from time to time. i loved to draw and write, and i was considered the ""artsy"" girl with a quirky sense of humor at school. i wasn't popular, but i had some friends that were and some friends that weren't, and that was perfect for me.

but things only seemed outwardly okay. in reality, i'd been struggling with depression and anxiety since i was 13. to be honest... i have no idea how i managed it. i just don't think i ever confronted my feelings or problems in life. i simply stuffed them down, ignoring what was going on... brushing off suicidal feelings as normal, okay. i was in therapy and on meds and, for the most part, played my role as the ""perfect daughter"". note that filling that role was really important to me. it was ingrained into me from a young age that i had no choice to be perfect (for multiple reasons). my brother matthew was autistic, and my parents spent most of their days taking care of him. i was allistic, educated, independent, talkative— the polar opposite of matt. and please understand, i don't hold any resentment towards him, because i love my little bro so so much, and have ended friendships because they treated my brother badly because of his autism. i wouldn't change him for the world. but the truth of the matter is, he got so much more nuturing and attention as a child than i did. it became a mantra in my head that my needs weren't as important as others' needs. to make matters worse, i also had family members that were kinda, er... delinquents? i guess that's the word i'm going with. they got in legal trouble and didn't take the ""traditional"" route of going to college, getting a job— they just caused a lot of conflict and stress. i saw my grandma cry over them. i was afraid that i would become like them... someone that just mooched off their family and shit in the face of everyone that cared. so i decided from a very young age i'd be perfect. i'd cause no trouble, i'd get straight-a's, i'd play a sport and an instrument and become a polyglot and an artist and a part-time novelist with a degree in international relations from a 60k/yr private school. and i didn't allow myself any room for compromise.

things started becoming less manageable when i was 15. i think i cut for the first time then, but quickly stopped because i got caught, thankfully. either way, i had serious self-esteem problems like every normal teen. i developed dermatillomania then, which is a nervous condition brought on by my ocd where i picked incessantly at my skin. like, 24/7. mostly at my hands, nails, scabs, and acne, where i'd peel off the skin until it bled. but i also ripped up my back. i would sit in front of the mirror every night in secret for 1+ hours staring at my skin, searching for imperfections, making myself bleed and actually cry from the pain. i wasn't sad, but my eyes watered because it hurt too bad. i don't know. looking back, i think it was a coping mechanism... it destressed me and it gave me control over my body, which was (in my view) ugly, awkward, ridden with acne, and drugged-up on meds that seemed not to even help.

the dermatillomania got better when i was 17 because my acne went away thanks to accutane. but my condition worsened. suicidal feelings were constant, oppressive, and sucked all the joy out of my life. i quit soccer and started having difficultly attenting school. then piano went. then my club activity died out and i stopped seeing friends. i didn't draw much anymore, barely wrote— except for depressing poetry that made me feel a little relief, if just at the moment. i started binge-watching tons more anime and became more of a shut-in. my brother's needs got more complex as he grew and people were less understanding, more harsh. my parents argued a lot. threw stuff. they said awful things and did awful things, most of which i forgot intentionally. i can't really... blame them or hate them, long term. they love me, i love them, and they tried to parent me best they could. but having two mentally ill kids— one also developmentally disabled— well, it put a lot of strain on them. my mom struggled with anxiety and depression, and my dad was angry and frustrated. days i couldn't get out of bed they'd scream at me and drag me by my feet or grab my hair and shake my head until i fell out of the bed. i would just externally shut down and go limp and they'd call me fucked up and stuff, and ask what happened to me. i didn't have an answer. it was like i broke! and i wanted to die more than ever.

around my 18th birthday (so march 2016) it was the worst. my attentance rate at school had dropped. i would miss weeks at a time. my parents would vaccillate between loving parents and abusers who screamed obscenities and shook me like a rag doll. anyways, i had exhausted med choices and i'd seen therapists and psychiatrists. so i was hospitalized because i ""wasn't functioning"". i was miserable at the hospital but oddly, at peace. i was diagnosed bipolar and they gave me new meds. when i got out i started attending group therapy and slowly but surely returned to doing schoolwork, mostly outside of classes but occasionally i'd go to a class or two. i was sort-of functioning. i didn't enjoy anything in life anymore but i got through, ya know? i forgot what it was like to enjoy writing or drawing or just life in general, but i was... managing.

i graduated (barely) and walked across the stage to receive my degree. i had a handful of very supportive friends who helped me become more social again. and now that i was free of high school, i felt like a huge burden had been lifted from my chest! i was free! my family was kinder to me. i felt less like a failure. i went to therapy twice a week and visited my psychiatrist for med evaluations monthly. i wasn't a huge fan of my meds— i still felt pretty ""blah"" about life— but i ignored that. 

um... i don't know how to sugar-coat the next bit of this. my cat died. my cat was my best friend, and the only one i really had who i felt fully supported me. laugh if you want, but he was my biggest comfort. when my dad made me cry i'd sob into his fur until my tears dried, and my lovely kitty would lick the salt from my face and just purr. one time, i was going to attempt suicide, when my cat knocked over the pill bottles i had lined up in front of me. he then rubbed against my hand and made me pet him, forcing me to also put down the pill bottle i held in my hand. i took it as a sign and didn't kill myself that day, thankfully.

losing him was a big loss but my entire past year had felt like one devastation after another, so i handled it okay. i cried it out.

shortly after i had an opportunity to study abroad in spain (i studied spanish in school and was pretty good at it), and i took it, flying by myself all the way from jfk to madrid! it was an amazing experience. i was proud to have flown individually. i was depressed during my stay (especially because of my cat) and i worried my host family a bit, but i did my best to enjoy it. 

i returned home. and you know, i realized, in the moments when i stopped ruminating and overthinking life, i felt... really, really alive. like when my friends and i went to denny's at 3 am and then ran around in a nature preserve, before crashing in my basement to watch bad movies. i fell in love for the first time and he lit up my world. i don't think i'd ever been that happy in my life, or at least not since i've been 13.

but the next stage in our lives was approaching. i forgot to mention above, but while i did not get accepted to an expensive private school, i did get in to the #1 state school in my state. i was proud. excited. scared, because of my meltdown senior year of high school. but i was ready to face it... even though i didn't want my summer to end.

i left my boyfriend at home and we decided to just be friends because he was a year younger and i was going 3 hours away. not a huge deal, but it also wasn't ideal to start a long-distance relationship after being romantically involved for just a few days.

when i got to college i was nervous like everyone at first, but i attacked it like my old self. i joined co-rec football and made lots of friends! i did laundry, fed myself, made my bed— the little victories. things i couldn't do 6 months ago. i was damn proud. i missed my cat and to a lesser extent, my boyfriend, but whatever! i was managing. i came home for a weekend and it was surprisingly nice to see my family, something i hadn't felt in a while. my brother sort-of hugged me, which was a huuuge deal. i returned to college confident.

but when i went to the classes... i fell apart. i was too anxious to do the coursework. everything overwhelmed me and i suddenly regressed and shut down, just like last march. i left on medical leave and returned home, dropping all my friends, and putting my future on hold.

now i have to start over. i lost all my old therapists and psychologists and psychiatrists, my parents are back to their weird abusive/loving/flip-flopping selves, and all i do is sleep. i've never been this miserable in my life. i have no ambition— i don't even know if i want to get better. i got a job at a daycare (keep in mind i love kids) but i just... never finished filling out the forms, and now i'm in limbo, debating if i'm even stable enough to hold a job. i do nothing. my cat is dead. i'm lonely, isolated, tired, and starting to realize that my family isn't going to help me ""recover"". it's gotta come from within, and i'm broken.

i'm going to a therapist and a psychiatrist... i'm trying to pick up reading and writing and drawing again, i've been even playing a little piano and learning the ukulele, trying to spark some interest. but i've got nothing. 

i know getting a job would help. i also think getting a new cat would be really therapeutic, and if i pushed the issue enough i'm certain my parents'll eventually cave. but... is that what i want? what about going back to college? am i ever gonna have that life i dreamed of? when did i become the problem child?

i just want to kill myself. i'm so, so tired. i'm not even scared of dying anymore. just... alone.

the only good thing in my life is my boyfriend, who i'm back with now that i'm home again. our 1 month anniversary of us since i got home (and what we consider the official start of our relationship) is october 3rd. i love him. that's naive to say probably, but i do. he makes me forget my sadness.

i... i don't know anymore. i'm so sick of this constant depression... i just want it to end. i want to die and leave this world. i want to stop being a burden and a fuck up and a failure. and i'm so lonely!!! everyone in my life has left me behind and all i have is a disappointed family. and my mom says having me around makes her depression worse. so i just want to finally end my life. i'm sorry this is so long, but i feel so relieved. i've never told anyone the whole story before.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i just don't see the point in continuing... why should i?26/dmab, identifies and lives as f... even though i'm just a sick tranny....

the more i look at things, the less i see of a reason to live. i started my ""hormone correction"" far too late in my life, getting therapy and ""help"" at 25 years old... a year later i thought i'd feel better, but i don't. i don't feel worse, but i don't feel better... it feels normal to be identified as a woman and treated as such and i don't face issues with misgendering. however, it just feels... empty, like everything is a freaking lie...

i have a serious anxiety attack anytime i take a shower, i have to close my eyes showering.. going to the bathroom and do things quickly before i have a severe panic attack. my genitals are the reason i suffer, they're wrong and mismatched and for as long as i can remember have caused me discomfort that has escalated with the years. i was told by a friend year ago when i was about to take my life that i could get help and work towards transition with the help of obamacare... and admittedly that's why i'm around today, because i did get help and i did get the treatment to start fixing my chemistry.

but there's so much damage already done, everyone i know insists i'm a ""cute girl who just doesn't like makeup"" but i always see a man, the man i was forced to see my entire life. the man my verbally abusive oldest sister constantly reminded me i was going to become. my family has tried to be supportive since i nearly killed myself over this... but is more neutral than anything, respecting pronouns and name but not helping me with literally anything else.. leaving me to do everything by myself, which i've tried... i've tried so much... i'm expected to know so much things that i never got to learn about.

i'm breaking down, i'm falling apart and i can't take it anymore... i was robbed of a life i could of had, because i was raised in a gender non conforming household. my natural behaviors and even stating i hated my genitals at a young age just seemed like me rejecting masculine social roles but it was so much more. i still get told i showed ""no real signs"" despite how much i hated my body and envied the hour glass shape... the soft features of most female celebrities and just the fact i hated my body with a passion. still do, even though i have the stature a lot of amab trans would love to have...

so now i'm spoiled.. and entitled, i don't deserve what i got and i deserve to die because i'll never know what it's like to not pass. with how many times i've been driven off to the er, i can't lie when i say i wish i did die those days. i'm nothing but a mistake... nothing but a freak and i just can't do it anymore.

my heart is at risk of heart failure due to my high levels of anxiety and stress caused by my recognition of my incorrect genitalia... i have to tuck 24/7 which is causing a loss of blood circulation with how tight i have to do it... the moment said tuck starts to slip i start feeling my chest hurt... i was denied trans healthcare by my insurance a few weeks ago and had to switch providers but who's to say the same won't happen again.. especially with lgbt protections being rolled back?

my psychiatrist is working with the surgeon who will perform grs to stress how medically necessary the surgery is for my case... but my mind is wavering and falling apart, i probably can't mentally handle the surgery anymore.. not that it'd be covered, not that my tranny surgery deserves to be covered.. doesn't matter if i'm dying from worsening anxiety and stress leading to heart failure, it's one life right? i mean who cares about one more male to trans dying.... i'm not an actual woman and i revoked my right of being a ""man"" not that i ever felt like one to begin with....

then the surgery itself.. the more i think about it, will it even help? what i want is impossible, i can't medically become a cis woman... i'll always be trans, and a trans woman... and i'll always be subjected to the stigma that i'm nothing but a man with the idea of fetishizing feminine stereotypes... since being outed as trans to my groups makes me feel more dysphoric, coming to realization i am a fake.. i feel like i'm hiding my black book.

a black book full of why i want to die and why i don't think this life is worth continuing anymore... how it feels like no one can relate to me dying to genital dysphoria and how a surgery that could alleviate said surgery is being seen as cosmetic and unnecessary... i can't work a job because of how alarming my dysphoria is and how frequent my anxiety spikes due to it.... my head is seldom straight anymore and the crappy contract desk wah job i have got me enough money for post care costs if the insurance does decide to cover it.. which they won't.

even if it all works out... i'll never find love because i'm too scared to make a move... too scared to risk telling someone i'm trans that i feel we connect and too scared to try and hide it and pretend like it isn't the case.. i'd probably be killed but.. it's okay, i'd deserve it.

so now i'm sitting here wondering how long it'd take me to die if i sliced off my genitals.. i don't care about pain, i deserve to suffer.. clearly.... i want to live, but i also don't see the point in trying...",suicide,suicide,1.0

"social exclusionhi

we often say, social exclusion for mentally ill is a problem, it shouldn't happen, etc, but at the end where is the problem ? isn't it at the end normal ? 


i mean, i'm ""somewhat successfull"" in music so it let me able to experience ""normal society"" sometime (happy people, ppl who do stuff, able to work 5/7 and stuff lol). 
i just stopped a relationship with a recent friend (my fault), and what happened is like what happened everytime, ppl can't take negativity (i bet this message sweat negativity too lol but now i don't give a fuck ive tried 28y to change), or various problem posed by any illness. 

but is there really a problem with that ? i mean, ive immagined myself in the head of my ex-friend, at his place i would be like him... there is no superior empathy to have to a group of ppl, in a way this is idiot


what i mean is that perhaps for one time we should take this as a fact, and not a ""should be like that"", and working from that. for example in my life ive already had relationship with girl in the past (when less ill), ive easier time now to say ""it's not for me anymore"" or imagine a life alone... ive had good friend (acutally the better relationship was the first), etc.... perhaps now i need another thing",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

i have my manischewitz concord grape wine here by me and i am getting pleasantly toasted. i can't get too drunk because my hubby has to go to work later and i have to be home with the kids, but i can drink until i feel happy. please don't lecture me on alcohol and my meds (meh...haven't taken them today...i know i know...don't say it!) or that self-medicating is not the way to go. it is the only way i can feel better right now and it is legal. now what i have planned for later is definitely not legal, but i don't care much. it is not like i will be out on the streets tokin'...my neighbor has a bowl and i've been invited over later for some fun while her daughter sits with the kids over at my house. i rolled my own joint a week or so ago (failed at it dammit...i am out of practice) and smoked it on my back roof that is right underneath our bedroom window. i got high and i felt better. i am self-medicating, self-harming in a way, and escaping this prison that is my mind.

but...i digress. thank you to everyone here. i appreciate you and i am not in a really bad place at the moment...just depressed. i still think of suicide a lot, but right now, i don't feel moved to do anything of the sort. i don't want to...i am already feeling the effects of the alcohol and i feel...okay now.

they don't understand that i'm fighting to get out of bed - not in the morning, but just overall. every dream is better than this life and i just cannot take anymore.

"took the wrong job out of college, no way out. just done.so i recently started my first job as a junior developer. i'm 28. i've known for a long time i didn't want to do this for career, because i'm bad at it and i hate the stress and anxiety it causes.

along with this i signed a one year lease. the lease agreement is clear that if you try to leave early, you have to pay the remainder of the rent. 

even if i could get out of that, my family keeps pressuring me to stick with it. ""everyone is lost at their first job, it takes time."" nobody will believe what i'm telling them, which is that i just do not belong at this job, i don't belong in the town where i'm living, i want out and now. if i were to up and quit tomorrow, my parents and siblings would just be ashamed and angry, i'd probably have nowhere to live while i look for a job. 

of course all of that is a moot point anyway because of the fucking lease i'm trapped in.

i'm literally in a situation with no escape. except to just end it all. i'm tired of having this knot in my chest 24 hours a day. tired of waking up from a nice dream, having a panic attack and thinking ""fuck, i'm back here again."" tired of being a burden on my family by always calling them to cry and complain about my life. just tired of everything. i don't want to hurt anybody or make them feel any guilty, which i know my parents will, but i can't go on like this anymore. i will never be able to just breathe and feel normal again. i'm opting out.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"trapped by chronic paini don't even know where to start.  i live in a small town that is killing me socially.  i have been on disability for years.  i have chronic neck/shoulder/arm pain that is constant and gets worse the more active i am from a simple accident last year.  most days i don't even say a word.  i don't take any medicine because it prevents me from working.  i have been out of work for a year.  i have some artistic talent and do digital work and have been trying to put together a portfolio to get work, yet it still causes much pain.  i am horribly depressed, yet i think it is a social problem more than anything, i do not watch tv or movies but just read and paint, i do not party, drink or do drugs but what motivates me is learning, so it is very difficult for anyone to relate to me and i think i am often misunderstood which leads me to being made a pariah once more.  i don't like joining groups.  but it is the pain that really gets me.  i have been to doctors and they just give me pain pills and tell me to come back in a few months.  i stopped the pills when i started developing a tolerance as that is the beginning of a downward spiral i did not want.  it has been almost a year and the pain is worse in some ways.  i think it might be worse now because my social situation has completely imploded.  no one calls me or invites me anywhere, i don't think a single person other than my parents have even checked up on me in over a year.  well no there is this one girl, but she lives over a thousand miles away and only stays in contact because we were working together on this art thing.  i don't really know much about her, or if she is even real, she is more like a character from one of my books. i have so much work to do, so many wrongs to right, but i grow weary.  over the past few months i have been giving away as much of my stuff as possible.  i have tried setting boundaries with the people that call themselves my friends, yet honestly i don't think that they really care if i am here.  i was always too trusting and never a good judge of character.  here is how i describe it:

today i thought of why different people see the same actions with different intentions.  i used the 3 main psychoanalysts of the 20th century to make the point.  when i see a person next to me at a coffee shop or where ever i might ask them ""do you know how to use after effects?"".  if what motivates and drives them in life is purely material they may think that i am attracted to them.  this is the freudian view, that what occupies people's interest is the physical sexual attraction.  evolutionarily this makes sense as those that possess a good physique can be beneficial for protection and such.  however with the rule of law, society, capitalism and the neo-cortex a person's ability to use their mind to dominate or create hierarchical relationships gave them an evolutionary edge over their competitors, so an adlerian perspective would be ""what are you trying to sell me?"".  then there is the idea that in every moment and every interaction we are interacting with projections of ourselves, not some object to give us pleasure through sensation or to conquer through taking its resources but an equal to us or in a sense a part of us that can help us learn, so when i ask if you know how to use after effects i really just want to know so you can help me learn how to use it quicker.  this final view i compare to jung.  what drives this last character is all the lessons one can learn about themselves and other people.

so what do i do?  the intense physical pain makes my life miserable.  i only don't really think of it too much when i am with people.  disability and local town make it impossible to have friends.  solution is to start a new life, which requires money, so work on art and such which causes the physical pain to increase, which makes me want to be around people more, attempt to interact with local population, due to their motivations being the first two of above they interpret mine as the same? i don't know how to interact socially successfully.  the only people that end up listening exploit me? i end up alone so i try to work harder to get out and end up increasing physical pain.

it is almost impossible to build a social network on your own, people that i could talk to, relate to and find someone i could trust.  my typical solution to depression is to exercise, yet i tried to get into that and it has only caused more physical pain.

i refuse to be a medicated zombie.  i have done it before, sure i was ""happy"" but that really isn't the most important thing in the world.  i don't know where to turn, or even who to trust, i have been burned so many times.

i just don't know what to do.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i hate my dad. he makes me want to kill myself.i say that really casually. but it's the truth. i hate him. i've never smiled at him since 9 years old. he always scolds me, swears at me for everything and anything. it's so exhausting. i thought he did it bc he cared, that he wanted the best for me but no. he screams at me all the time. how useless i am, how i'm a disappointment.

it was fine til i was young, 8 or something, i really liked him back then. but then as i grew older, he started making me feel more and more unwanted. he's pretty pedophilistic too. i'll be sleeping and he'll kiss my cheek, right besides my lips and won't stop til i wake up and push him away. i wear shorts in my house usually, and he'll make these comments, ""i want to lick you"", ""i'll bite you on your ass"" and it makes me really uncomfortable. when i was 11 something, he said, ""i wanna give you raspberries on your stomach"" and then he scooted right over and did it, i tried to move and push him off but he's way stronger than i'll ever be.

i don't know what to do, who to tell. he makes me want to kill myself. i want to live, but i don't want to live with him, i don't want to be near him. it's been going on for about 8 years now. i really hate this. when i was younger, i had written this letter to my mom saying that i was sorry for all she had to go through, he'd fight with her a lot too. i apologized and said that i should've never been born, that it was my fault for being alive. that man made me regret being alive at 9 years. i want help, i really do. but i can't get it. i want to go away, with my mom but i can't. everytime an argument starts between whoever, it always ends him bashing me and swearing at me.

if anyone has been here before, can you please explain what it was like for you? what were the major issues, what did you do to get past it? what was helpful, what do you wish you did differently? how is life now? are you ever scare one day all your progress will fail and you will go back to being close to suicide?

"free, no bs, tutoring office hours style on twitch. i'll be around for the next two hours or so if you have any questions that i might be able to help with  

right off the bat, this is 100% completely free. i don't ask for donations and i don't want donations. i am so committed to this that i have promised to donate any money received to charity, and i'll post the receipt on the discord to prove it.

now that's out of the way, hi! i'm arch, a college graduate waiting to get into medical school. in this next year i want to give back a little bit to the community and thought that tutoring could be a useful service to offer. my sister is a teacher, and she's told me that the pandemic has been really hard on a lot of students. that is why i am offering office-hours-style tutoring on twitch. i figure twitch is a good way for people to show up and ask questions without needing to sign up and lose their anonymity. i am a neuroscience major with a minor in astronomy. that means i have plenty of experience with the core three sciences and can (hopefully) help explain some of the more difficult concepts to you should you need some assistance.

again, this is not for money or for karma or for clout. show up for five minutes, ask a question, and leave without a second glance or follow or whatever. this is supposed to be a no pressure environment where students can get some additional help if they need it. come and check it out if you want or send the link on to a friend if you know they are struggling with something in school. absolutely no personal information is required. no names, no emails. jump on twitch and ask a question in the chat, or follow the link to my discord in case you need to post a picture of a problem etc. there are no stupid questions. all i ask is that you be kind and courteous to anyone else in the stream and that you forgive me if i cannot answer your question.

(i am not going to do your homework for you. just want to help with conceptual issues.)

the twitch is [twitch.tv/archexplains](https://twitch.tv/archexplains)

and you can find more information and clips from previous streams on my website: [archexplains.org](https://archexplains.org/)

i want this to be a resource that anyone can use for a quick question or for in depth help. if you have any ways that i could improve the service please do not hesitate to let me know. seriously, i just want to help, i know how frustrating these subjects can be when you feel like you need to teach them to yourself.

"am i really depressed? (long) (no suicide risk, go help people who need it more)just saying beforehand, i have bpd, so that's a big playing factor. and i believe both my avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorders are what cause a majority of my confusion.

i've also never actually fully gone through with any of my suicide plans, and most likely never will, which is another thing confusing me. like, am i actually depressed, or am i just threatening suicide for more attention? 

anyways, i tend to flaunt my depression around, because still being here is the only thing that makes me feel a little strong. it's the only thing that i'm actually proud of. and i'm scared to leave this area. the more depressed i am, the stronger i feel, but i may be misconstruing that, and i'm actually trying to drag myself deeper so that i can make more people miserable.

i've been told that i'm manipulative. all the bad things that people have said about me, i remember, and then i constantly search for evidence of those in the things i say. and when you're watching out for hundreds of things every time you type a simple message, it gets stressful...

**anyways, let's get into this stream\-of\-consciousness piece of shit.**

i'm 16, and i honestly don't know if i'm depressed, or an asshole. sometimes i say i'm lost, misunderstood, confused, scared, alone, and going through something worse than anyone ever has. i say i look towards other people to help me with problems that i can't solve myself. i say that, when i'm threatening suicide, i'm doing it as a cry for help, because it's the only way i know how to properly convey what i'm feeling. i say i don't kill myself because i'm scared of what may meet me on the other side.

other times, i tell myself that i'm not going through anything serious. i say that the reason that so many people have ghosted me isn't because of how depressed i am, but because of what a shitty person i am. i say that i'm a leech and use other people's altruism to make myself feel better, before leaving them in the gutter. i tell myself that my suicide threats are just ways to squeeze more attention out of people, since i never plan on actually going through with them.

i've been told that i'm too young to actually be depressed, that i joke about suicide, that i'm a horrible, manipulative person, that i lie, that suicide is just a permanent solution for a temporary problem. i've been told that i'm so young that i have no experience, that people are going through worse, that i should get over the past, that i've put no thought into what i say or how i act, and to pay attention to the people who are really going through shit. i've been told that the only way out of my situation is to hoof it out, or man up and solve my problems myself. all that bs.

i used to be an altruist \(if that's even a word\). i'm an infj\-t, and i used to give my life away to help others. i think how this all started was being taken advantage of. i'd help people, they'd throw their problems onto me, say that i didn't help them at all, and then they'd block me on all forms of contact. left alone with these problems and feelings of inadequacy, i became this. i had all the positivity sucked out of me, and now i'm terrified of doing the same to others, so much so that that negative suggestion has actually turned me into what i fear. or maybe i'm just helplessly searching for a way out.

i have no\-one to talk to about these things. not family nor a therapist or even friends. i can't get any help except people on the internet, because i can't stress out my mother any more. i can't call a hotline, because i know that other people need it more. all i'd be doing is clogging up a spot. 

i tell people i'm a bad person because i look towards others for validation that i don't give myself, and when i'm told i'm a bad person, that's all i believe. so i warn everyone i meet. but then, when i have depressive episodes, all those raw, unexplained emotions and hopeless justifications are looked upon with hostile and malicious judgement, and makes people think that i really am a bad person. it perpetuates a cycle where i'm misunderstood.

i just don't really know anymore. i push my problems onto others, without them asking, in an attempt to find some reason why i am the way i am. because i can't find it out myself. and i know that i'll never go through with any suicide plans, but i still say them constantly. am i just scared? or am i really just a leech? am i, just because that's all i've been told i am? if i am, then why don't i just do one good thing with my life, and make the world a little better by cutting off said leech? i'm confused and really just need answers...",suicide,suicide,1.0

constructive feedback would be appreciated! &lt;333

    she wants what’s best for me
    but she seems to refuse to accept me
    she says she loves me with all her heart
    and i know this
    
    but does her love have to be so oppressive? 
    her interest in my love life this obsessive?
    
    she says she’ll accept me for whatever i am
    accept my sexuality
    accept my gender
    accept my friends
    and i know this
    but goddamn!
    
    she’s a great mom, always has been
    spent 14 years of life raising me to be a good man
    says that won’t change, even if i don’t feel like a man
    and i know this
    
    but when i told her about my pronouns she says she sees me as a guy
    when i told her i’m not straight she says she doesn’t think that i’m a gay
    who is she to decide who i am and why?
    who is she to monitor my dress and my love life?
    who is she to scroll through my phone, yelling at me for looking at pictures of my boyfriend’s thighs?
    
    she’s only trying to protect me
    and i know this
    
    but i don’t want her protection
    i don’t need her protection
    if her protection comes at cost of my privacy 
    so she can see what i can see
    i’d rather she just pack up her “protection” and leave me be
    so instead of watching my every word i can relax and be carefree
    and she knows this
    
    i’m old enough to make sex jokes with my friends
    i’m old enough for her to stop watching me to no end
    i’m old enough for her rules against dating to bend
    and if she doesn’t give me my space, well, i’m scared our relationship will not mend
    this isn’t what i want, i wish she were still my best friend
    but she refuses to accept who i love and who i am
    and i know this
    
    ten years in the future i wonder
    how will she feel that she missed my first date?
    that she wasn’t there to help me primp, get me there on time so i wasn’t late?
    will she be sad that she wasn’t there for my first kiss?
    wasn’t there to listen to me ramble on about the bliss?
    maybe she’ll regret she didn’t help me with my first significant other
    that i didn’t feel comfortable telling her i got asked out, though she’s my mother
    i love her despite all this
    but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t make me pissed
    and she knows this
    
    the funny thing is, this isn’t how it should be
    the kid who has gay parents should be more free
    to express and explore their identity
    but instead, i find myself writing this soliloquy
    not being able to fully be me
    using my preferred pronouns only around the few friends that are closest to me
    
    so what if my boyfriend’s polyamorous?
    that doesn’t affect us
    so what if i might want to be olivia instead of oskar?
    that’s not something she seems to want to discuss
    
    i am genderfluid
    i am queer
    my boyfriend is polyamorous
    and so what?
    this doesn’t affect her
    and even though i love her
    she refuses to let me be with who i want to be
    she refuses to let me be who i want to be
    she refuses to let me be

"i'm not worthy of helpat some point you understand life well enough to determine that nothing here is worth living for. you question everything. students studying hard in school are smart, but when you question why you are even working so hard, reality hits you. why even continue this? nothing matters in the end.

i'm not religious at all but i would describe life as a place between heaven and hell. you get a mixture of both. unfortunately the negative overrides the positive. you role a dice and if you're lucky you get a 6 and born into a great environment and time. 

i can't keep lying to myself like i've been told. i'm a loser because i never won. i'm a parasite and a burden because i bring nothing to the table. i'm ugly because i would never get that attention and i hate my body. i'm pathetic because i'm weak, useless, have no skill, no talent and i'm always seeking for validation from people. i'm stupid because life events told me so. i'm envious and jealous because i get upset looking at happy, good-looking people. i'm evil because my thoughts are evil and because i'm writing this for attention. i'm ignorant because i have opinions in topics i have no experience and no research in. i'm a coward because i'm afraid of too much normal people don't fear.

sometimes i wonder: why do i feel worthy of help? i don't even deserve basic humans rights. every time people give me advice, i never follow through with them because i'm a coward. what kills any self-improvement is this:

1) i assemble all my problems and look at how many there are and how extreme they are 

2) i wonder where i should start

3) i get advice on reddit/youtube/google for something more simple that i can work on everyday, usually my social   
anxiety. my enemy here is my brain.

5) i get anxious overthinking it because i have no distractions. i makeup situations in my head and get scared.

6) i go back to the start and look at all my problems again

7) i look at all of my skills, talents and achievements. basically what i have to work with (i have nothing)

"applying for graduate school is causing me anxiety and driving me into depression, but every other possible future also freak me out. help.at undergrad i was extremely depressed, and almost took my life. i was kicked off my division 1 swim team because my coach said i was ""mentally unbalanced."" after swimming i started to get a little better, but still felt pretty useless. my boyfriend and friends definitely helped though ( for my first two years in school and on the swim team i was completely alone).

i majored in history and loved it, but never really thought about the future. my depression was pretty much the reason; i never thought i would be alive long enough to have a job. i was pretty certain i wasn't going to live to be 21/graduate. i ended up graduating. i wrote an undergraduate thesis, and graduated with honors. 

after graduating i didn't know what to do, so i moved home. i'm not sure if living at home is facilitating my depression or the cause of it, but i'm really unhappy. my parents don't understand and i don't really know how to tell them (my dad thinks i'm just overreacting, and my mom just thinks i want to be perfect and i'm not realistic). 

after working two years part time in an after school center for middle school kids (which i love but don't feel complete in) i've decided to apply to grad school. i love history, and what i miss most about graduating is that i'm not surrounded by the same passionate driven people. part of me is scared however that i'm applying to have a better college experience (i didn't really make a lot of friends) or because i need a phd to prove i'm smart (i'm not exactly brimming with self confidence. plus my sister is getting her phd in plant biology, and i've always been looked down upon as the little weird sister.)

overall applications are just making me freak out. i don't know if i want to go to grad school but i don't know what else i would do. i feel trapped, but i also feel like i'll fail no matter what i do. i'm scared that if i can't prove to myself that i'm worth something (like getting a phd) then i'll just drop into a deeper depression. i'm scared i won't be able to talk myself out of suicide again. please help.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i really fucked up and i'm really in immediate danger.context is important.
i recently moved across the country. i'm 17 and emancipated in junior year of high school. i moved to minnesota near extended family, but i've had a really hard time fitting in. my social life is nonexistent and the combination of work and school stress is killing me. but i recently began treatment for depression and have seen mild improvement with medication.

so onto today. i have settled into a social circle somewhat. they tolerate me most of the time and are generally friendly but it's obvious i don't fit in. i'm from the south, crass, loud, and emotional. they are quiet and reserved. match made in heaven right?

so today the topic of assisted suicide came up during lunch for a project someone was doing. we went off on a tangent about suicide in general. i asked everyone whether suicide is ever justifiable for someone's circumstances. someone said ""no because family"". i retorted with ""how selfish is it to ask someone to continue suffering by living just so you don't have to suffer?"". i didn't realize two of my favorite people at the table lost their cousin last year to suicide and i just accidentally called them selfish for wishing they were alive.

ive already had such a hard time fitting in. now i feel even more caustic and vile, and that the only way to prevent me from being a negative aspect of more people's life is to die or move across the country again.

"a downward spiral of self-hatred. [long post]hey reddit.

so, i understand that there's a number of posts on here. despite that, i'll deposit my thoughts here. i've recently moved from a place of comfort to somewhere that has posed some challenges. i'm a 19 year old college student, and i'm struggling to keep everything together. i've struggled with depression for as long as i can remember, and i thought for awhile that i had defeated it. last year, i was hospitalized because i got overly intoxicated and downed an entire bottle of ativan.  whether i meant to attempt suicide or not, i'm not sure. that happening is one of the reasons i moved, to try and start over. things were going ok for awhile, i was lonely, but managed to make some friends via a club at my school. well. i managed to mess that up. i drink to self medicate, and because well, i just like it. well, we had a social event for the club, and afterwards, most of us went back to one member's house and drank/hung out. i drank in excess and proceeded to be a complete asshole. i was forgiven by my club, but not by myself. some time passed from that, and que my next fuck up. one of my classmates had invited me to a party one evening, and me being bored and lonely, happily accepted the invitation. well, again. i became overly drunk, and had to call the person i'm dating to come and pick me up. i spewed in his jeep, and i foggily remember punching myself in the head because i had fallen. woke up on his couch, he drove me to my car and we parted ways. i texted him apologizing, and offering to clean his vehicle and whatever else needed it. got a reply that said things were fine. well. fuck. my own self deprecation messed that up, too. i hate myself so much. i hate my brain, it dips in and out of these highs and lows. i've been diagnosed with mdd in the past. i want to kill myself, because it seems that no matter what i do, i mess it up. but, there's still a small flame in me that believes i can do something with my life. i'm trying to find things as an outlet. i started training in bjj and mma last week. i found an old bottle of wellbutrin, i took one tonight and i'm going to see if that helps. honestly, i don't know what to do with myself. besides social matters, i'm struggling with coming out to my hyper-conservative parents. they honestly shouldn't even be married, they hate eachother. but that's a completely separate issue. thing three...i've taken on a lot of difficult classes this semester, and i'm struggling to keep up. on top of that, my mother is pressuring me to teach myself calculus. i don't have the time to with 15 fucking credit hours. 

that's all i really have to say. it's a giant wall of text, a ramble, and i'm sorry.

i've always been a strong kid, i really have. but i've been living in this hell for almost a decade. but these past few years everything has gone south. my parents forced me to get an expensive car when i was 16, paying for it all myself. over $550 a month, they didn't do shit to help me. i wanted to buy a car outright with the couple grand i had saved up, but they had other plans. instead i used $2000 as a down payment because i wasn't allowed to purchase anything without a warranty. so now i was 20,500 in debt in high school. i had started smoking cannabis to help clear my head. oh man, you have no idea how much of a relief it is to not have thoughts of suicide invading my thoughts every waking moment of my life. but with school and being 16, i legally couldn't work enough to pay for the car and other expenses. so i turned to selling cannabis. i made enough to get food and pay for my car now, maybe go to the movies every now and again. but that's not me. i used to be a good kid, i never thought i'd turn to selling drugs. i cant help but resent my parents for what they turned me into. 

when i was 18 i moved out, into a my best friends trailer with his father and girlfriend. if i stayed with my parents i wouldnt be writing this now, i would have done it already. so now i had to pay for that bullshit car, and pay rent, and pay for food, and pay for my animals, and pay for everything else i needed. i couldn't sell my car because i was hit twice, once by a texter, another by a drunk driver. it was worth 6 grand less than i owed on the loan. when i was finally able to get rid of it, i got an old piece of shit suv for free, no a/c, windows dont work all the time, holes in the seats, rust all over, locks dont work, etc. i pay 3× as much in gas. i dont want to go to jail, so now that i am an adult i chose to stop pushing weight and just work legally. so i was working 80+ hours a week. i couldn't do it, i was so close to ending it working so much. so i kicked it back to 60 hours, and one of my jobs doubled my workload and asked me to clean biohazard without proper equipment. i quit, i'm not getting diseases from cleaning up shit without protection for minimum wage. 

so now i work 2 days a week at another job, and do craiglist work when i can find it. what little money i had saved up is gone. i refuse to turn to selling drugs again. and in this small town, i've applied at every business within 20 miles. i've gotten interviews, but that's it. i have no useful skills to get a real job other than retail. i have no way to go to college. i have no way to get an apprenticeship because they're all so far away, i'd hit empty before i got to work on the first day. 

i have nothing anymore. i used to have good days. i used to be able to talk to people without it draining me. food used to taste good. i used to be able to sleep soundly at night. i tried going in to get medication, but i'm so scared to take it. i'm so close to killing myself and i dont want the medication to put me over the edge. i cant afford the gas to get to a reputable psychiatrist, nor can i afford the copayment. i'm in debt with no way to pay it back. i cant even afford food for my animals this week 😭 i've never seen a future for myself past 30, but recently i dont even see next week. i'm sorry. if you read this far, you've done more for me than anyone else in my life has. i'm so sorry for this jumbled mess, i pulled into a parking lot and i've been crying this whole time. i left so much out but i just cant think straight. i'm sorry.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i want to work so bad it is literally killing me inside that no-one will even look at my resume, or won't offer me a living wage.

i just found our that my rent is going up. one of my bills has also doubled because of a late fee since i couldn't afford to pay it on time. i am just so done. i hate myself and i hate my life but kost of all i hate living. for the first time since i moved out on my own i wasn't able to pay rent this month and my roommate had to make up the difference. it's looking like that will happen again next month and on top of that i have no idea how i can afford to pay my bills now. my savings is gone, cost of living is rising, and i am just a burden on those around me.

"i'm giving life just one more chancesorry for any grammar mistakes. i'm suck at grammar.

i have all my suicide notes written except for one that i need to do tonight that goes to my youth minister and his wife. i'm writing this to vent i guess. to see if there's anything still worth living for. i've tried to find something anything that's worth staying for. but i couldn't find anything, so i know my worth. 
my worth is nothing.

 i'm tired of not being good enough. i know i'm not good enough. because i wasn't good for my former moms, the only people who actually treated me like a son. but i screwed that up cause i'm so stupid and worthless. i put all my value on them and cause mental strain on them so they had to leave me. everything that they told me feels like such a big lie now. all it did was reinforce my mom issues, abandonment issues, and touch starved issues. i want someone to hold me and give me affection like they did. i can't see anyone as family anymore cause if i do i feel like they're just gonna leave just like my moms did. i miss them so much. i just want a actual mom. 

 i'm not good enough for other people. i had a crush on a girl who we'll call sophya, and sophya liked me back. so we talked more and she told me that she wasn't ready or mature enough for a relationship. which was fine with me and i told her to do what's best for her. but guess what she does next? she goes and dates my one of my best friends. she said that she liked both of us. but ultimately she ended up with him. it not even that i wish she would get together with me. it's the fact that she told me that she wasn't ready and told me no then got together with someone who i thought i could trust and wouldn't hurt me. that literally tells me that i'm not good enough for others.

all i ever do is upset my friend group. i don't deserve them. i'm so openly suicidal with them and joke all the time about how i want to die and kill myself. they get upset with about how much i talk about it. which is fair. but it's just a cry for help but they don't seem to notice. that's not their fault in anyway i should just be honest with them and that's on me. i understand that. i swear i'm the worst friend that they could have. i feel like they just hang out with me out of pity cause i'm not good enough. i don't deserve them.

finally, i come to my youth minister and his wife. i've always been close to my youth minister since the 7th grade and i'm a senior now. so he's gotten to see me go through junior high and high school. he's filled the dad role in my life. since my actual dad never really gives me any attention. i've only grown close with his wife over the past year. she always just been a trusted adult that i could go to if i needed any advice. as she's a very logical person. since my moms left me i've been looking at her to fill that mom role in my life and she haven't. i shouldn't except out of her as she not the type to do that. the only people that i can think of who would miss me would be them as they been apart of my life for 5 years. but i know i'm just a disappointment in their lives. my youth minister says he see me as his son but again, i'm just one big disappointment so i feel i let him down a lot. i wish i could live with them and have a better support system then what i actually do at home. my dad and my stepmom don't care about me or what happens in my life. but i'm so afraid that they're just going to leave me. i haven't spoken with them for awhile and i feel like if i kill myself now i don't have to deal with the pain of them leaving me. 

i hope you enjoyed reading about what is the mess of max's life. i plan of killing myself when the next time my parents are out of the house. i'm gonna go buy some pills and overdose. i have nothing to live for. i'm done. i'm worthless and no one will care when i'm gone.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i really need some advice. (maybe from someone knowledgable on emotional abuse)i might not be exactly suicidal, but i really need help because i am undergoing some immense struggles and being forced to make decisions that are life-changing when i'm only thirteen. my parents have always been alcoholics and it's been really stressful for me. i have always had a gut feeling it was emotional abuse, and i'm almost definitely sure it is now. the only reason i haven't called cps or the cops is that i have friends in the area that i live in that mean the world to me. i know that a lot of teenagers feel that way, and a lot of teenagers would say that they have met people that they will be ""friends forever with"". it's hard for me even to put into words how much support they give me, and how many anxiety attacks they've helped me with. i love them definitely more than i could ever love my mom or dad. the other part of my family lives across the country and i just cannot leave these friends. they're like the only family i've actually had, but not biological. there is a list of terrible things they have done to me. never physical but i can say with confidence that i would be a lot happier without them in my life. i've told them that i was gonna call cps, but they keep telling me to do it cause i'll just get put into some dirty house with a foster parent who would treat me terribly. it also sounds cringy as all hell, but i have a boyfriend with a bad homelife too. he has been through the world twice and has helped me look at the brighter sides of things. a year ago i was pretty suicidal, and he was always there reminding me about the future. again i can write essays on how much i admire his strength in dealing with all this, but our plan is to get emancipated in two and a half years and living on our own. i just dont think i can wait. my mom and dad look at me like some naive little girl, or like they give me everything and all i do is disrespect them, but i wasn't the only generation of they're children that absolutely despise them. i have two older sisters who had do undergo the same things as me. they ran away multiple times, and the only reason they still talk to my parents is because i am with them. they are only around 20 years old and i really don't want to burden them with having to take care of a teenager for the next two years. i didn't have it as bad as them, because now my mom is somehow financially stable enough to get me videogames and such. my dad is unemployed but says things like i am ungrateful for all the things i have. i can't even combat that cause i don't want them to take away my only escape from reality which is talking to my friends and playing videogames. and now that i read back on this post, it might seem like i'm some spoiled brat but i can't even list the things they've done to me cause i might have a mental breakdown. i seriously don't know what to do in my situation. it's really late at night (or i mean early in the morning) and i'm even afraid that they'll hear me typing and find this. i have admittedly been kinda rude to them lately, but i think it's well deserved. again theres an essay i can write about what happened tonight, but it's not even worth it at this point. i just want some answers in life. i've tried researching why people think cps is bad, and i've gotten articles upon articles on abuse situations. i don't know how to escape this hell. i try to avoid my parents at all costs but recently cause we have been moving apartments, they have not only took the lock off my door (not cause they think i'm cutting myself, because they think i'm watching porn) but they have also been yelling at me nonstop. i really enjoy psychology and i think my future career will be based on that, but i've researched some things and i can tell exactly when they are being manipulative. if you have been a victim of abuse or know anything about cps or if you come up with anyway i can be freed without throwing my family of friends away it's really appreciated. sorry this is so damn long. i just needed somewhere to vent and somewhere to get advice. also this is probably littered with mistakes of all sort and i am absolutely terrible at telling a story but yeah. there we go.",suicide,suicide,1.0

my story  
i was adopted at age 2 &amp; 1/2 by my parents i have today.  i don't know/remember too much about the whole adoption thing but i'll say what i know.  my parents told me i was found (not by them) near a police station.  i had been with my birth parents for about two months.  in a way i feel rejected by them.  like they didn't want me so they got rid of me.  on top of all that i have this thing called möbius syndrome.

here's a brief breakdown of what it is.

möbius syndrome is a rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side to side. most people with möbius syndrome are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions.  


 honestly i look like an absolute weirdo.  a few years ago i struggled with self worth.  i just felt like i didn't matter.  that kind of went away for awhile until this year.  this year it has hit me a lot harder.  i feel depressed 75% of the time.  now more than ever i'm considering suicide.  i have started cutting myself and i've been getting high.  getting high takes me away from reality for a while.  no one really cares about me, so they wouldn't notice if i left.  seriously, they wouldn't.

i don't want to die.  but i don't want to life feeling depressed and worthless.  i just can't..

"why is life worth living?i have bin out of a depression since 2-3years. although i am happier with my life and have no plans for killing myself i still wish i was dead.

allow me to explain, see, i got into a depression when i was about 10-11 and it lasted till i was 16-17 but i have obtained the notion that life is an overall negative, most of our time is spend doing things we don't want to (school, work, taxes, traffic jams, other obligations/nuisances), and all of evolution is dependent on the death of the genetically inferior and struggle for survival. this is a very deep conviction i hold to be truth.

while i am out of a depression i still maintain this belief and in all honesty think that death is just an objective better state then life, it is easy to keep living to not hurt my friends and family which i find too egotistical of an action to do. but i would very much like to join most of my fellow man and believe that life is actually a positive thing that should be cherished or atleast that death isn't a better alternative. is there any objective reason you can think of that would prove this to me?

the last 20 years have been a complete waste and it feels impossible to come back from that. there’s the ex gf that broke up with me on he day that i was going to propose. had the ring in my pocket, even. thought it was perfect but found out later she’d been cheating. went from her to a girl i married in spite of red flags. i thought i couldn’t do any better and just dealt with her emotional abuse. i’m now divorced and being forced to sell my house and move in with parents in my late 30’s. just a complete failure. i’m looking at being stuck living with them for years while i pay down the debt i’m in thanks to ex wife. 

then there are the friends. i already don’t have many and try to fake happy but they still fade away or cut contact. even that gf mentioned above. i tried to hate her but couldn’t and we were friendly a couple years later but recently, she called. i thought just to catch up but no, she was just beating around the bush before saying goodbye for good.

someone killed themselves jumping off a parking structure at a nearby college campus. it worked for them, but i’m scared that i’d survive by some sort of horrible anti-miracle.

so here’s my plan.

i drive a white car. i worked years for it. when my family’s out, i plan on getting my car in the garage, shutting all the doors and running it. i’d grab a few thick-tipped black sharpies as my car runs, and i’d write all over it. i’d write how i felt. i’d write the names of those i’d loved during my life, the ones who helped me through the hardest of times. i’d write apology letters to them. i’d write the things i loved about them most, and the people i looked up to. i’d write to my parents and my siblings. i’d write to my remaining grandparents. 
i’d just write.

and when i’d feel tired and my “note” would be complete, i’d just lay down and go to sleep.

"i need this life to stop.hi there. this is my first post here but not the first time i stop to read, thanks for the support you give, it meant a lot even without being involved in the thread. 

i am sorry if this gets a bit too long, english is not my first language and i'm not used to talk about feelings, so i might need more words than strictly necessary. 

the main point of me writing this post is that i'm sick and tired of my life routine, but complaining about it only got me very bad reactions. 

maybe i am lazy and spoiled, maybe i was too lucky for most of my life and now i can't cope with work because i have no discipline. that's what my girlfriend seems to mean when she complains about me complaining. 

i'm almost 31, for the last 15 months i've been working day and night with a partner on our own business. things are starting to work out, we are hiring our first employee, who is finishing an internship in a month and seems to be a good fit. 

for the first time in months, last weekend i could sleep more than 6 hours and ""forget"" about work, maybe some day this week i can even get home before 20:00. 

everyone around me says it is worth it, they seem to be pretty sure about it, way more than i am. they say it's an investment and we are lucky to have clients in this economy. 

fuck that shit. i can't afford to buy soil for my plants (soil is dirt cheap, literally), i pay the bills and the end of the month starts on the 5th for me. can't buy clothes to wear for work, can't go out to dinner, not a single night, can't afford my cat to be sick because that means using my business credit card and being even more broke for a couple of months. and i am hungry most of the time because my stomach is way bigger than my bank account. 

i think of death as a relief. i think of killing myself every day, but i just can't. it makes me think of my loved ones having to pay for a crappy funeral where no friends are going (i've been a terrible and very distant friend) and it makes me sadder, but it takes suicide out of the picture for a while. so i light up some weed and it lightens up my mind. i've been an occasional smoker since i was 16, but with my financial history i never had a chance to abuse. last year i grew a couple of plants and that's how i can afford it now. for the last month i've been trying not to smoke for a week and didn't even get to the first 24 hours (i've had plenty of weed available for the last 7 months, but this habit is new). 

i don't know if the drug is causing a depression or a depression is making me use, but every day i feel like killing myself until i smoke and then i look at my problems in a different way. i wake up my ass from the couch, cook some shitty shit and go to bed defeated again. i can cook like a pro, but i just don't want to any more. 

it feels like the only thing i can decide about, and taking the choice of smoking again while i listen to some music is the only moment of happiness i can afford. 

my girlfriend used to be a loving and supportive one, but no one loves a broken man and i know it's just a matter of time till she leaves. it makes me sad, but i made up my mind long time ago, it's quite understandable, no one wants to live like this. 

for the business, things have been growing quickly for the last 5 months, at the beginning of 2016 i was looking for a job, just to know what i could afford to look for, but not with the biggest expectations. i got the interest of a couple of big firms, but i ratted out because i got some clients and i hoped things would get better faster. i always had problems with authority and i am scared of having a boss and not liking him, i tend to do stupid things like pointing it out in front of everybody. 

at this pace, i might be able to take some days off this year, but i don't know if i have the strength to get to that. i feel exhausted and sad. 

my mother, the one who might have spoiled me by filling my shelves with every book i asked for, was diagnosed with cancer last december. she's gonna make it, the diagnose was on time, but i haven't been able to visit since her first chemo session, which was at the end of january. and that hurts, like it hurt when i couldn't visit my younger brother in hospital after a spine surgery. 

i just can't find a meaning for all this. i find myself crying alone at least once a week, and that has never happened to me. i don't want to take any drugs, not even marihuana, of course. i just want to get back to the gym, sleep 8 hours and have some food on the table. and i feel so weak, because i know there are people out there with bigger problems who deal with it, but i can't even find support. people look at me like my brothers do: the big guy with tons of confidence and all the answers. but i am done, behind closed doors i am just done. 

i thought this was gonna make me feel better, but i already stopped twice to cry and that's too much feelings for me. thanks for reading this, i hope i can write something funnier soon.",suicide,suicide,1.0

(i ended up fine, i called the poison center bc i didn't wanna kms but i'm fine now) anyways i got so high that i texted my friend a bunch of bullshit, basically that i felt like i had to conform to society's standards of femininity otherwise i was worthless, that i wasn't conventionally attractive and tired of it, that i was tired of feeling different and that i should just do everything society expects me to do and be as a girl. yeah, i was really high and that was embarrassing lmao.

i had promised myself that i would stop telling my friends about my ""problems"" and my worries because i didn't wanna be a burden to them, and yet again, i broke that promise. 

oh, and i have my exams starting in 10 days which i'm probably going to fail as well because i haven't been able to study. academics, the only thing i'm usually good at, will be gone as well.

"tips for dealing with regret about not having gone through with it after you've been ready?twice today i was ready to go. i've been close before but not this close. i tried sleeping after the first time but it just made things much worse, i was just extremely disappointed when i woke up. i had written goodbye and was about to send it to the person i was talking to (chatting with) and go do it, when something distracted me (my memory is a little hazy). i regret just having waited / talked to someone and not having done it when i could have, i still want to die / think there's no other option anyway for a list of reasons that would take a huge wall of text to explain, but i doubt i could still do it now. at this point i'm basically just waiting to get triggered again to then be able to do it, which shouldn't take too long considering how many things trigger me.

"why does no one understand that i just don’t want to be here?i’m literally only here because people guilt me with “everyone will miss you, i’ll miss you”, “you just have to find the parts of life worth living for”, yadda yadda. 

it’s not that i don’t love you, people. i’m just not interested in life. it literally does not interest me. i find things to pass the time before i die. if i was told i had terminal cancer, i’d be relieved. 

it doesn’t even feel like depression anymore because it’s not sad to be, it’s just disinterest. o am disinterested in life. i’ve been dragged to a party i never wanted to go to. i’ve seen what’s to offer and none of it interests me so i’d like to leave. 

“no, no, stay. the party will get better, we promise.” 

again, not interested! it’s just so...boring. it’s dull. it’s more work than it’s worth. there’s bills, taxes, expenses. you have to work. like it just sucks. i get that you’ve found a way to make that enjoyable and you know what, good for you, i’m glad for you. but i’m not interested. no, i don’t want to write for a living even though i like writing. i picked writing as a focus because it made me feel good and i was good at it. no, i don’t want to help people for a living, it made me and others feel good and i had a talent for it. there’s nothing inherently fulfilling about life itself. i have nothing to gain from it and your pithy statements about how i just have to find my thing or my passion only exhaust me more. 

that’s the thing. i’m exhausted. i’m done. i feel like my grandmothers did when they passed away. how my mom felt when she passed away. i’m just done. i’m weak. life took a lot out of me and it continues to do so everyday. please, all i ask if that i find out i’m deathly ill so i can go to a hospital or something and die in peace. that’s all i want at this point. i want to die and i’ve wanted to die since i was 10. it used to make me sad, but now the sweet release couldn’t come any quicker. there’d be no stress anymore. no more deciding what to do, no more deciding who i am or who i want to be, no more thinking, no more feeling. my brain could finally be uncluttered. it’s been cluttered my whole life with thoughts and ideas. i wake up every morning with it swirling, having to organize everything so i can be a functional member of society. 

sometimes i think i’d like living if it didn’t require so much work. what if i could just stare off into the distance all day? no decisions, no tasks, no lists, no responsibilities. just sit and stare. to have a mind uncluttered. that’d be nice. but it isn’t like that. just to live, to have a place to sleep and fill basic necessities requires planning and thought and care. it’s too much energy, to even get the thoughts to stop swirling. they just don’t ever stop. even to clear a space to write these words is a chore. i’m exhausted. i’m exhausted. i want to sleep. for a long time. for forever.",suicide,suicide,1.0

a month ago i was attacked when i was walking home alone. when it was happening, i couldn't take my eyes off the knife they were threatening me with but i wasn't afraid of it. i wish they had killed me when they had the chance 

maybe my thoughts are just repercussions of what happened? i've not been dealing with it well, but i thought time was supposed to let me heal? not make me feel worse? i'm just so sick of being afraid of going outside 

the comedian i mentioned in my title is the only reason i haven't done anything seriously damaging to myself. i have a long history of self-harm, but i refused to let what happen give me an excuse to go back to old habits and i've been relying on him (the comedian) to make me feel better when things haven't been so bright 

it's been like this for about three years since i started recovering from self-injury. i followed him on twitter very shortly after i made the conscious decision to get better and i'm not really sure how to explain it, but it became a weird promise to him that i wouldn't ever hurt myself again. (he didn't know this for a very long time but i did tell him eventually.) 

i don't know. i guess i just turn to him when things are bleak. i read his tweets, watch his videos and go through his blog and i'll feel better. he makes me insanely happy 

him and i are verging on the 'friend' status at the moment. i don't really know why, but recently when i think about ending it all, i think of him and for some reason he's enough for me not to do it. is that weird? relying on a comedian to keep me alive?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i don't knowi really don't know what to think anymore. i've been depressed for over a year, i've been consumed by self hatred and wanted nothing more than to die. but about three weeks ago, a girl from one of my classes, from out of the blue, messaged me, asking to hang out. we did, and it was fantastic. things got better, i have never experienced such happiness as watching a movie with her as she rests her head on my chest. but now i don't know. 

she noticed something was wrong with me, and i went ahead and told her about my depression and how much i hated myself. she seemed surprised. from then on, she started answering my texts slowly, or not at all. we used to talk for hours, and now she barely acknowledges me. last night i had an episode, one that nearly pushed me over the edge, so i messaged her, out of desperation, hoping for just a little bit of happiness to come from our conversation. 

but nothing came. she was snide and sarcastic, completely different from usual. i was devastated. i thought about taking that beretta out from under my bed and putting it in my mouth then and there. the only thing that stopped me was the thought of how sad that would make her. 

but now i don't know. i really care for her, and i want the relationship to continue, but not if she's unhappy. but at the same time, im completely devoid of anything attractive or beautiful, she doesn't deserve to have to deal with me. i want her to happy.

"writing ‘that’ note latelythe suicidal thoughts and attempts on my own life caused me to be extremely hateful and cynical to the people closest to me.

recently one of those close people suggested to me that i should write it down and reflect upon it. this has pretty much turned into me writing notes for those closest to me for after i attempt suicide again, successfully this time. 

i never thought writing it down would help me, it only helps me prove how i feel and that i’m nothing but a burden upon others. i stopped talking to the girl i loved because i couldn’t bear to have her or myself any more committed then we were. the feelings i currently have about myself and life are the worse i’ve had in recent memory and the only positive i see on the horizon is stopping myself from living.

"i’m done with my life and i plan on hanging myself in my basement once everyone is asleepi always was bullied for my learning disabilities, my grades and it basically ruined me for as long as i can remember and especially how my teachers and mom told me i needed new friends and they weren’t really my friends, which i think started my trust issues but i guess they were right. when high school rolled around they ditched me, but i was more or less my moms fault for posting about them on facebook. 

then i was forced to get a job i didn’t want which affected my mental health and school work and fucked up my anxiety. i was told i would be working in the back not with customers because of my anxiety. which was fine with the manager but i was always put on store front and it sucked, i wanted to quit but my mom said she’d hate me if i did.

then it started with mom saying i made her hate her life, and then i caused my dads diabetes and that they’re marriage is failing because of me, my two older sibling didn’t help when i tried to talk to them about it.  this shit hurt the absolute worse. all because i didn’t have a job but i was afraid to get one because of my last job.

i had a break down one day and my dad tried to punch me in the face.

then my girlfriend got pregnant and i was happy for awhile but she miscarried, and my work forced me to go in the next day. no one cared and no was supportive at my house and i wish i had the kid because maybe i’d be happy. 

no to short after i got a puppy, he’s the only reason i’m living and i love him more than anyone and anything.  one day he got into an unmade couch that was left on the ground. my sisters were in the process of moving out but i didn’t actually know what it was and he tore up some off the stitching. luckily it wasn’t the part of the couch you’d see. anyways my sister got mad and demanded if something happened like that i’d owe 500 bucks. i told her that’s ridiculous and it was mistake from my dog and you should have told me or something what that was anyways.  and if it was so important it’s not my job to look out for it. don’t just leave it on the ground and don’t care. 

we got into a screaming match, she called me names and blamed me for things. i was done with the argument and went upstairs my sister followed me into my room even though i closed the door and continued to hit me three times. i was broken inside i left the argument and yet she wouldn’t stop.  she then proceeded to cry about how shitty i am while my other sister comforted her outside my room right in front of me, one the words my sister said was i hate you and i hope you die.  our relationship is better but i don’t really feel comfortable being around either of them and i don’t think i can ever truly forgive my sisters or my parents. 

then my ex has been doing this thing where we say we’ll work things out and i’ll stay at her place for week and then when i leave she’ll find something i did wrong and leave. it makes me depressed and sad for weeks and no matter what i do or say she doesn’t care.

i don’t feel like being alive anymore, i’m my short 20 years of life i feel so shitty all the time about the stuff i’ve done and how my anxiety has ruined any from of relationships i’ve ever had. 

i actually plan on hanging myself later tonight, i’m not expecting anyone to read this or respond because it’s kind of long but i just can’t do this anymore.

an incident happened. it was summer holiday, and there was an annual trip to georgia, “the math summer camp”. au was the main guy and the responsible for everything that happened there. it was not obligatory, but many people were interested and went there every year. but this time it was different. for some reason, some girls had no drinking water. wanting to drink, they approached the kitchen sink... and then it all went downhill. due to bacteria in the water they were poisoned, and suffered a major damage for their immune system - even the flu could kill them. that was terrifying. my close friend was among them too. but it didn’t stop there. some people, mostly parents, started blaming au for this - and they were partially right, because he was the one responsible. but the girls who suffered from this, and we, their classmates - we didn’t blame him. it wasn’t his fault. it was a misfortunate turn of events.

unfortunately, au got fired after that. or, rather, he forcefully resigned. we have a good teacher now as well, but losing him... that was sad.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"i don't know or remember what it means to be happy.i have diagnosed depression and, i suspect, am bipolar. i alternate between severe depressive feelings and rage so bad it brings me to physically shake. i'm a 19 year old gay guy, and i've been in one relationship in my life, a year ago. it ended with a guy i thought was still my friend apparently never talking to me again. at first i still had something like hope after that, but i remembered it took me *years* to be open enough to consider dating someone, especially another man with all the stigma that's been around that my entire life. i don't know if my parents never gave me the attention that i needed or whatever, but i don't ever remember having a real loving connection with anyone except for that one boyfriend. even as a child: my parents told me that if i did something bad, they wouldn't have to scold me for it. they'd pull me aside to talk about it, and i would send myself to my room and cry to punish myself rather than listen to the reason that what i did was wrong. for over a year now, i've felt completely alone. i took antidepressants for a while, but the entire time, my mother (who's medical insurance i was under) was more focused on getting off the meds than getting me to a point where i would want to live. i've been diagnosed with depression since 2012 but, thinking back, i can't remember a single time in my entire life that i was ever happy or satisfied with my own existence.

i have 4 people i consider friends in my life. these 4 people put up with an enormous amount of my bullshit and i honestly feel horrible for putting them through my issues, since i know that one of them, my best friend, is also at least slightly depressed. i've been pushing them away further and further over the past few months, and i can tell they don't want to see me as much or go places without telling me about it more than they did before. if i lost them, i'd lose what little reason i had to stay here on this life. they're all i have, all i ever have.

speaking of that best friend, i've felt something like love for him for a long time. it wouldn't be a problem considering he's bisexual, but he also is in a monogamous relationship with a girlfriend (one of the other 3 friends) that i have no desire to interfere with (not that he'd pick me over her). he's my best friend, and i love him more than anyone else, but i know he won't ever love me if only because it'd be easier to explain being with a woman, never mind the fact that he has most certainly been turned off by my fluctuating level of sanity around him.

my friends told me i was making them uncomfortable with my constant suicide ""jokes"" or comments or making ""vietnam flashback"" faces, but goddamn it i'm not trying to be such a miserable bastard.

i don't know if i want to kill myself. i've held out for 19 years in the hope that one day, i'll find someone who cares about me, that i can care about, and we can just be happy together. i worry though, that the quality of life i'm in *is* my life, and i'll always be like this. i've been like this my whole life, i don't think i can ever change. i could never be fair to someone else in a relationship even for some reason they found a reason to like me. that's all i've ever wanted, i don't live for myself, just the possibility of someone else. if it ever got bad enough, i know i have the tools to do it quickly and painlessly, and lord knows i think about it all the time. but i haven't gotten around to actually pulling the trigger, probably only basic human survival instinct. oh well. that's my human conversation for the day.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"my fucked up, bipolar (maybe) life. part 1: well. fuck. im gonna start this now. so what i do is i basically have just been writing down how i feel and taking mental notes. well let's just say my life and my mind is fucked up. here is a little backstory: i felt really odd the past few months, i had my shit together, felt obligated to help a friend out, lost my shit. after a month(ish) of rapid and unsettling ups and downs, i came to two of my friends to see help. they delivered through hugs and goodnight texts. i've gotten so bad that if i dont receive multiple of these a day i go through a really bad phase throughout the night. 

i decided to start this now, simply because last night i had one of the worst (if not the worst night) of my life. morale of the story, i made plans to get breakfast with said two friends the day before. i didn't hear from them throughout the day and my mind took over. i stabbed myself in the arm a few times, and i was having a mental breakdown. just picture this: teenage boy sits on bathroom floor, almost in tears, shivering and bleeding. now your simple soultion to this is to text my friends. well, turns out they are hammered at a party and can't even type out legible response to what i'm sending them. ""well fuck"" i just feel worse and worse. im not feeling ok. im wishing for death. and in my mind there is no way i'm going to this breakfast plan i have in the morning. (see prior post) well. here comes day one of this journal.

i maned the hell up, got up in the morning and drove to these breakfast plans. im fucking terrified this entire ride and i dont know how i will act, whats gonna happen, if i'm mentally ready and plus i really suck in social situations anyways. i have no hope. well, i get there and they show up, i give out some hugs, my mind keeps running and i cant even focus on what i'm doing. we sit down, i'm just staring off into the distance, dying on the inside and trying to make sense of my situation. they really gave a solid effort to talk to me and make me comfortable. i really didn't want to show them how mentally weak i actually am and how fucked up in the head i am. so im trying to focus on that, but its just so hard. i power through, i think i did alright. i never looked at the menu. just had them bring me something out. the food was good, but fuck man, it was hard to not breakdown in the middle of that breakfast place. honestly i cant remember much of what happened, they spent most of the time talking about how hammered they were and all the crazy things they did last night. i was just so uncomfortable and upset. but, as the breakfast went on, i did feel better. i almost ended up in tears once but other than that, it went swell. i gave one of them a solid 30 second hug at the end and i honestly felt much better walking out of there than i did walking in there. that paved the way for my day and i was (mostly) happy for the rest of the day. 

for future context: i am not medical diagnosed as bipolar. im just saying this off my quick switch in moods, my super highs and super lows, and all the different mood i live with on a daily basis.

moods: 

1. normal me: rarely shows up(me right now), but is easily the best version of me.

2. euphoria rush me: randomly happy for no reason, i can never focus, my eyes go crazy, feels like i'm high of meth.

3. depression me: this is when i feel really low, and i just want to cry and disappear from the world

4. murderous me: well, this is the worst version of me. all i want is death, i will harm myself, i will want to physically harm other people. and i cant sleep, i stay up all night walking around plotting. i hate this me.

"life is so tedious and lonely**tl;dr**: there's nothing to make life interesting, the people i care about are gone, and i don't think i can handle the future.

i’m really just bored and tired of life. it’s so tedious, and i’m realizing that the world of opportunity i expected once i left the rigid structure of high school is just a myth. it hasn’t gotten better; it hasn’t even gotten different- going to classes, doing homework, and intermittently having a decent time in college is not the welcome change from high school that i was hoping it would be. i’m trapped on this campus with no means of escape, bored out of my mind because everything is still too easy and i can’t help but doubt what i’m doing because of that. i sought out a challenge, the hardest major and the hardest minor in a college with a reputation for making them harder still, and i find myself relearning the basics of vectors in half my classes. i have nothing more to do than sit in classes, walk back to the dorm, sit in my room, and maybe eat if i even care enough to do that.

it’s so lonely here, too. my longest term friend, someone i’ve known for most of my life, is here with me and yet it’s meaningless because we still have nothing to do together. as long as we’ve known each other we’ve never had very much in common, and the mutual clubs we did in high school are behind us now. and all those people who were in the clubs with us, the people who were like family, are out of contact. my boyfriend, who i’m still technically dating, remains in high school 2 hours away, but that distance is insurmountable without transport, and somehow is unchallenged even over text. i’ve written him so much about what i’m doing and who i’ve met, i’ve asked him questions about how his life is going, and i’m fortunate to get more than a dozen words in a week. he was the person i could talk to, and who knew about all the troubles i had with identity and my family, and i was the person he told about his struggles with stress and his own suicidal past, but he’s never around to respond to me anymore. when we were together we’d do everything- we’d play games and go out and watch movies- and he kept me from being so bored with life and caught up in my own head. without him i have far too much time to myself.

while i cite boredom as my cause, and it certainly is among the reasons, it’s also stress. i don’t know if i can manage once my classes actually do get hard and i’m so uncertain of myself. i took a test earlier and i changed my answer after seeing a person near me put down a different one that also made sense. after the test i checked and i was right, and i just feel so awful for doubting my answer, especially when it could bring me down a letter grade on the test. the fact that i wasn’t certain of the answer, and that i didn’t prepare at all for the test… i don’t know if i’m as ready as i feel when the teacher is going thru material that feels like review. i don’t know if i’m in the right major either, even tho i don’t think there’s any i would prefer. i really don’t care that much.

i also feel so robotic. i identify as agender and asexual, a hollow person who hardly feels human and is pathetic at interacting with others. i can put on a front to make friends, with smiling and some excitement, but really i don’t care about any of these people. the people i did really care about seem to be in a different world, and the most important person i’ve had in my life for the past four years is hardly in contact.

i’ve thought a lot about suicide. i don’t see life getting better, at least not fast enough. i can’t stand to wait years when the 24 hours of a day feel like an eternity. living for the future feels so awful, but there isn’t enough to do in the present. nothing can occupy me enough. i’ve done art, videogames, programming, streaming shows, countless clubs, school work, and just walking around campus but nothing can hold my attention for more than an hour span before i get bored with it. there just isn’t enough to do in a day, at least not enough that i care about, and certainly not enough to fill the rest of my natural life without a terrible feeling of pointless tediousness in each passing day, where all work is put towards a future that can hardly be better.

if i made an attempt on my life i would certainly succeed. i wouldn’t want to suffer life beyond an attempt, for i can imagine it would be even worse than the present. it would be quick, after that moment of doubt that is probably inevitable.

i know that i could just continue life and i would do fine, but i don’t feel like the effort is worth it for an end goal of getting a monotonous job, maybe finding a person i care about, and maybe getting to travel or do other interesting things.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"softening the blow: is it easier to mourn someone you hate? should i leave them with great or awful last impressions?i want to make it as easy as possible for my loved ones. do i make the effort to push everyone away and make them hate me? (eg cheat on my bf) do i make this next month and a half a nightmare for everyone so that they can let go of me easier? or do i try to make these last interactions happy and memorable so that they remember me in a “good light”? if you’ve ever lost someone to suicide, what’s your experience? how could they have made it better for you? in this scenario, not killing them selves isn’t the option, though. the question is how could they have eased the pain. 

i don’t want to, and i’d probably cry the whole time but ya, i am considering cheating on my bf to soften the blow but i don’t know if this would make it better or worse? finding out someone was “not who you think they were” could help, right? like, i’m wondering if it would be a good idea to kill two birds, by becoming a cam girl. it’s not that my bf thinks sex workers are gross or anything, it’s not that that would hurt him. it would be that i’d have been keeping a secret, that i’d been unfaithful, that i’d have been so “desperate” (bc it’s just not like me) and that i was able to be sexual with someone else when i can’t bring myself to do anything with him (sup low libido due to persistent suicidal ideation, hows it goin). plus i’d be making money that i can put toward funeral expenses. my bf is already so drained and i know that staying with me is killing him, which in turn, kills me. he needs to be freed. they all do, really.

"my mind is full of fucklast month i've been somewhat depressed and it's fucking frustrating.

it started when a friend told me over chat he felt kinda down and wanted to see a psych. a week later i was feeling completely useless. tired, but sleepless. hungry, but without any kind of will to eat. i cried randomly while thinking of a relative dying and i feel like i've given up on life. i see no future, no purpose, i don't know what i'll do when my parents die. i hope i'm not going to go as far as suicide, but i keep thinking of hypothetical situations where i'm in mortal peril, and i just give in.

i decided to stop that cycle last week, and forced myself to eat, and stay up and work on my projects. it got me up, a lot. i spoke to a friend and we talked until i broke down crying, and that cleaned me up a bit. i'm trying to turn my shit around and go back to jolly old me. i'm trying to wake up early (i think a huge part of this is my bad eating habits) and be with my family and friends more (another huge part of this).

i've always had his back despite him being very unloving at times. i became his support system as he has very rough ties with family. he doesn't have many friends, has trouble keeping a job, he has trouble with school and he lacks the motivation for basic things. i never blamed him for it, i blamed his depression. the few moments he had clarity, he would show me what a beautiful person he was. i did not leave him *because* he suffers from depression.

but we have no future together, he has other plans. my career will take me across borders while he wants to take over his friend's business. i want to have children, he doesn't. i want to travel and see the world, he wants to settle and doesn't care for other cultures. all in all, we're incompatible.

he wanted to go cold turkey, no contact. he does this when times are tough, he shuts down and pushes everyone away. he won't respond to my messages or my calls, he won't answer the door and his friends haven't seen or heard of him for a few days. i know he's alive, he's still online on social apps sometimes.

i love him but we're better off like this... but i can't handle the thought of him doing something drastic because of me. what can i do? my friends are telling me to let him go, to forget about him but they don't know him like i do. i don't want him to die.",suicide,suicide,1.0

i also suffer from bipolar manic depression. i was medicated many years ago, but haven't been on anything besides marijuana for a while. lately, because of everything happening, my mood swings have become more and more drastic. this morning i felt like the most powerful man in the world (manic stage) but tonight i feel worthless. i've studied computers my whole life (wrote my first program at 4) and it feels like everything i've worked for is out of my reach.

i'm losing the pointless health insurance i had, and my doctor won't write a letter stating i'm unable to work. i'm married and the thought of not being able to provide for my wife just depresses me more.

to top it all off, all the friends and family i've supported through their troubles (depression, drug addiction, etc) are nowhere to be found, or telling me to ""look on the bright side"". i feel very little support.

"how do i tell my (sort of christian) parents i don’t believe in god? i had a revelation recently and realized i was atheist. now, i’ve entertained the idea of being atheist, i just never fully thought of myself as atheist until now. with everything that’s been happening, i’m fairly certain there is no god. 

i’ve hinted it towards my parents saying something along the lines of “would you be disappointed if i didn’t go to church when i grow older?” their response: “yes.” 

however, my mom showed a bit more mercy. she told me that at the end of the day, it was totally my decision. i’m a little reluctant to tell her still because her immediate response was yes. she had said this after she thought about it.

my parents are really loving so obviously no hate towards them, but my mom came from a very religious family and so did my dad. so how do i tell them i don’t *actually* believe there is a god?",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"boyfriend is possibly suicidal -- been depressed for years.hey guys. i met my boyfriend (i'm a guy, btw) in march, and we've been getting along great. the more i get to know him, however, the more he's letting me know about his past. to be short, i'll say he went to a hardcore christian school that forced him to suppress his sexuality and his gender identity for years, all the way through high school. now that he's a year out of there, it's starting to come back to him. 

there have been many nights where i have held him for quite a while while he cried and told me rather horrible things that his peers would tell him and how callous all of his teachers were. he feels like he has no friends (he pretty much doesn't) and his relationship with his parents is shaky at best. almost everyone he took for a friend has betrayed him or won't accept his personality. he really is the nicest, sweetest guy i've ever met, and it's not fair.

worst of all, he let slip that he was feeling suicidal in a conversation a couple days ago. he denied it outright when i pressed him for the truth, but the other day i caught him in the bathtub doing what i think was trying to drown himself (good thing that doesn't work). i don't think he'll actually pull it off, but it worries me a lot.

i've been there for him in the ways i can think of: re-enforcing that he's a great person, trying to expose the irrationality of his peers, taking his side on pretty much everything (and most of the time i agree with him). he's also been taking little steps to help himself (deleting his facebook, shutting out so-called friends, trying to reconnect with his parents). 

he's been telling me a lot that i don't deserve such a ""wreck"" and that he's ""broken,"" in the sense that the school he went to has made it really hard for him to trust anyone, including me.

i guess i have to ask, is there anything else i should be doing?",suicide,suicide,1.0

"25 with tinnitus, this feels like torture, how can i live with this for the rest of my life?i noticed it suddenly one night, just out of the blue. i don't even really know where it came from. suddenly my head was filled with all these cacophonous buzzing and hissing noises. i also get this low-pitched eeee in my left ear too and some really low almost rumbling/humming noise that makes my left ear feel blocked.

i can't lie on either ear as it makes the sounds louder. it's been about two months and i still feel terrible at coping with this. people say you get use to it. i still feel so claustrophobic and trapped. when i'm in my room, it feels almost surreal, with all the buzzing and pressure and everything. i just want some peace and quiet. i'm not a big fan of loud places either, only ever attended 1 concert in my whole life.

and at 25? this is something people get in their old age. it feels so unfair. i don't want to bring it up with my parents or brother anymore because they can't do anything to help me and it makes them feel terrible in turn.

i just can't cope with this incessant noise. i'm going crazy. every night for the rest of my life? i can't do it. i just want to die quietly without my family knowing. i feel like my quality of life has been reduced to like 5% now. i spent the whole day in bed, things i use to enjoy seem sullied now. i'm an avid hiker, i love being out in nature and enjoying the serene calm and silence. this is like a huge blow to me, never being able to enjoy that again. all the money in the world can't cure this. it just feels so hopeless.",suicide,suicide,1.0

my cousin just committed suicide a few days ago and i really miss her. i'm slowly losing my will to live because she was my best friend and i don't know why she would do this. i feel like i have no one to talk to anymore. has anyone else felt this way before? feeling like no one understands you?",suicide,suicide,1.0
"just trying to come to terms with it alli have been fighting myself for years now.. i have never been able to tell anyone what i'm really thinking. everyone thinks that i'm happy and making plans for my future. i know that if they had any idea what was really in my mind they would be shocked. everyday for years.. my mind seems to revolve around the idea of just ending it. over and over. when it gets bad i try my best to be logical about it.. that it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. but it just seems like these temporary problems keep coming at me to the point that it's hard to breathe. when i'm driving i think, ""what if i just kept going straight instead of taking this curve?"" or ""what if that car veered off into my lane and i didn't swerve out of the way?"" ...or i'll take a bath and see how long i can stay underwater without breathing.. i feel so disgusted with myself everyday.

both of my parents were druggies who were here and gone and in and out of jail. so my childhood pretty much sucked. i was in shelters/foster homes on 2 separate occasions. from the ages of 7 to 15 i was molested by different men. it started out with my brother making me get into a makeshift room with his friends little brother while he and his friend watched through holes while they made us rub against each other.. that brother molested me on and off until i was a teenager. then there was my mother's boyfriend.. that one hurt the most. i thought of him as my second father.. we were so close.. but when i was 12 he shoved his fingers inside me and tried to rape me. even though i told my mother about it, she still talks to him 11 years later.. and then there were a few men during the time i lived with my mother while she was dealing drugs. one night i woke up to a man masturbating with my feet. needless to say, i was a pretty fucked up kid. and ever since then i have had twisted thoughts regarding sex and penetration. even the thought of putting my fingers or a dildo inside of me makes me physically sick.

recently, i had a short wave of hope. i am in my senior year of college. and though my depression has affected my grades a bit, i am close to graduating. but then the anxiety of knowing that i probably won't be able to get a job after all this makes me feel smothered and there's constantly a huge weight on my chest. anyway.. though i am paying for college myself, i always had it covered.. even though it got really tight sometimes. but this year.. since it is my 5th year.. some of my grants were no longer applicable.. and i got all the finaid i could get.. and still ended up 2k short. so i started applying for jobs everywhere.. and i had one hope from them all.. but then the guy blew me off at the last second.. but i had one more hope.. when my grandmother passed away she left me her land. so i have been talking to someone about buying it.. but now she's getting hard to get in touch with and i'm 85% sure she changed her mind. on top of that, my car broke down so i am car-less. i have zero friends here anymore.. and i'm so stressed.. i feel so anxious about having to drop out of college come mid december and being homeless.. and i just don't know if i can do this anymore.. i know that these issues may seem so small... but i feel paralyzed. i just felt that i had to get this off my chest, even if it's just to a bunch of strangers on the internet.. but i think that i am going to make a bet.. if my land sells then i will stay here a little longer and graduate college and try to find a job.. but if it doesn't sell.. i will box all of my belongings so no one has to be bothered.",suicide,suicide,1.0

&amp;#x200b;

i'm a little... scattered in the head right now. i hope you can understand what i've typed.

&amp;#x200b;

there is some triggering content near the beginning. please skip it if you have dealt with sexual assault. when you see the paragraphs again, it's finished.

&amp;#x200b;

i (26f) am considering suicide tonight. it's not sudden. i have been thinking of it for a while. i have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ptsd for about seven years now. i believe i've had it longer than that.

i don't like being alive. every day is a struggle. it's easier when i'm talking to others, but when i am alone, i get stuck in my head. and... and my head isn't a very nice place to be. i don't think others realize how much i'm struggling. i wear this happy mask so seamlessly that it seems to be my face.

it isn't my face.

i was sexually assaulted in my youth, and in my late teens. i feel broken. i feel worthless. i feel like nothing i does matters. i have three close friends, yet i don't feel like i belong. i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. i'm waiting for that moment where i screw up so badly that the friendship is over. i feel that i'm always going to be second best to everyone. i don't have a romantic relationship, the only one i've ever had was abusive. 

i have this pathological urge to be perfect--i have to be perfect, i have to make everything better, i have to be better. because it was my father who raped me, and i kept silent about it. when he molested me, i told my mom and she believed me. my brothers didn't. police came and picked him up, and soon, it was up to me to know if he could come home. i said yes. i was twelve.

what a stupid fuck i was. 

fast forward two years. i stop going to school because i'm tired of being bullied. i'm tired of pretending to be okay. i'm tired of the cruelty of children. my father gives me some of his medication to help me sleep. 

i wake up and he's hurting me.

i think it's a dream, and i stay home again.

he does it again. 

this is not a dream.

he asks me if he can do this to me every day.

i tell him no.

the look on his face makes me feel like i took back something from him. i feel strong. i feel scared, too.

i'm smarter this time. he gives me the pills, and i pretend to take them.

he lays down for a nap. gets up later and asks me why i'm not asleep.

i counter with ""why should i be?""

i realize he wouldn't stop if i stayed home again.

i didn't sleep that night. afraid he'd hurt me when mom was asleep.

i go back to school. the taunts are more tolerable in comparison with the possibility of facing that again.

i can't tell my mom. i think it's my fault.

that was in the past, and i'm in therapy now. i'm still that child, because we all still live in the same house. and i still try to keep everything together. i always thought if i got better, if i went to therapy, then things would be better. it's not better. i was so stupid to think that i could change things. i hate that the decision fell on me. i love my mom, and i hate that she had me decide. i wanted to make her happy. i wanted to make sure that she wasn't overwhelmed. therapy just reminds me of how immature and stupid i am. medications don't help.

i'm such a mess.

recently, i was interested in someone... and i thought it would go somewhere. i felt so happy just being near them, my heart would beat faster, and i always was excited at the thought of seeing them. and the most shocking part? they seemed interested, too! i was filled with hope, with joy, with amazement, that maybe,just maybe, my therapist is right. that i am worthy of love, and that people do like me.

such sweet lies i've swallowed.

i believe i am too much, or, paradoxically, i'm not enough because now i realize i was so stupid. maybe it's my warped depression lenses and maybe it isn't, but i do know now that it was all in my head. there was someone else. just seeing their expressions is a give away. there's always someone else, and i'm never enough. i don't want to hope and think it's nothing. you don't look at each other like that and say it's nothing. i'm not letting you lie to me. i'm not letting you hurt me. i'm not letting you use me as an ego boost, or lead me on.

i'm in college and i hate it. i hate being around my former crush. i want to confront them, and tell them to give me a straight answer so i can stop having these lingering feelings. i hate the fact that no one sees me when i'm not smiling, or if they do, they ignore it. i hate that when my mom sees me sad, she gives me hugs and i know that i'm just going to keep hurting her. i hate that no one seems to care, even though i like to see them smile each day. i hate that i feel so...

empty.

i don't think i can do this anymore. day in and day out, it's the same thing. maybe this will change things. for my family. i just cause trouble for them. i made my mom keep my father in the house. my brothers don't drive and they depend on him for transportation. they don't know he drugged me and raped me. i heard her tell my aunt (her sister) that her anniversary is just another day. she's not happy. i'm not happy. all because my dad fucked up, and i fucked up. every time she tells me not to do something because he's around, it reminds me of what happened.

i'm tired of feeling responsible, when i know it isn't my fault. i'm tired of thinking i have to keep the family together. maybe it's time for it to fall apart. i'm tired of therapy, calling for coaching, using skills. i'm wasting their time. i'm so worthless. i can't do anything right. they won't miss me. they'll probably be relieved that i'm gone. 

no more me asking peers if they'd like a hug today. no more offering them food. no more annoying them with stupid questions. no more moronic me. no more mom worrying about me being in the house alone with my father. no more uncertainty. no more painful hope.

no more.

this is the first time in a long time that i'm starting to feel... content. euphoric even.

i must wait though. i won't let them see my body. i will leave them a note.

i hope they understand.

i need this. i need this. i need to do this. i need to do this for me. i need to do this for them. so this is me making things right, trying to make things right for them and for me. i've been dead for a long time. it's time to make it right.

"suicidal, just want to my story heard...here goes...this is what i get for being brutally honest in a world full of lies.

i am suffering, and i just want others who are suffering to know that i am suffering along sides them. that we are brothers and sisters in pain, and you are not alone. i dont need any sympathy, kind words, pitty, or encouragement; just want others who are suffering to know that in here with you, and possibly a little help. but you all may not agree with me, as im not entirely sure anyone has, im a bit of a pariah.

this is going to be a long one, and please excuse the grammar; and if you're triggered by poor grammar/writing then i suggest not reading this because i asure you, you will be. i barely graduated high school, have adhd, the school system 'force passed' me through all my classes because they knew id never get out of school if they held me back, passed me even when i failed them because of my condition. my attention wanders so often and so much that i have a very hard time learning or concentrating. 

where do i start? from the beggining?. to truly understand you must hear my entire life, to walk in my shoes.

i am asian american, my parents are refugee immigrants from the vietnam war. they seen the true horrors of war, family members horrifically brutalized by war. whole tribes slaughtered by communist soldiers after the us pulled out. so my parents are very cold and dead inside. my parents beat me and my siblings ruthlessly, like a chained animal, often for simple things like just playing in the dirt when told not to. they used us like punching bags to vent their anger. beatings occured almost every other day, i had 5 siblings so there was plenty of punching bags to go around. when one child was too beat up, they'd just go to the healthy one. i grew up in a loveless family, we find showing any kind of love towards each other as awkward; touching/huggging/kissing is absolutely no go territory. 

i was born in california, moved to the east coast in the 80s when i was 9 years old. california was very tolerant of many races, it was very rare to witness any racism, until i moved to the east coast. being in the 1% minority living in the rurals, me and my siblings suffered from constant racism daily. usually the typical ignorant racist stuff, chink, ""go back to yuuur countraaay"", ching chong, people making slant eyes with their fingers, and less often physical attacks. so you could say my childhood confidence levels were not going to form to its fullest potential.   

i was a middle child, so i often felt like a red headed step child(cinderalla effect, step children/no blood related are always treated poorly in families by the non related parent). in asian families the eldest is treated with the most responsibility and held up as the golden child, the one to save us all. the youngest is treated like the baby, no matter what wrong he/she does they always manage to eek out of trouble. so naturally me being the punching bag i was in the family, took a lot of my anger and frustration out on my siblings and had a lot of outbursts of emotions in school because my life was so bad. many days i went to school right after a severe beating or mental abuse from my mother.

lets talk about my mother, she probably is the single most influential person in my life for my low quality of life and suicidal thoughts. i feel like hurting her just to go to jail and waiting out the rest of my days just thinking about it now. my mother is the most toxic person i have ever known. i believe she is a bipolar narscissistic sociopath. she will use what some call triangulation often. she will butter up to a family member and talk trash/lies behind another family members back to get the other family member to reveal something negative they have to say about the other family member, then go back to that other family member and repeat the process in order to turn us against each other, she is absolutely wack and sadistic, total psycho. we lived in a house with drywall for a decade, the walls were paper thin, and you could hear every conversation and whisper, everytime she gossiped on the phone she would tell her friends how terrible her children were and how great she was. all id heard from her was ""i wish you were dead"", you're so worthless, worthless, deadbeat, you'll never amount to anything, wish i aborted you when i had the chance, wish those mushrooms i ate killed you in the womb(she tried to commit suicide when she was pregnant with me inside her and ate poisonous mushrooms). she did 100% of the mental abuse in my family. she was and still is a constant cloud of negative energy in our family. when her storm raged it was a category 5 hurricane in the household. 

my father was betatized by her and she commanded his every whim. he was like her champion or the kings executioner/sheriff. if she wanted her children beaten to a pulp she would command him to do it and off he went. my father never stood up for his children, he was as afraid of her as we were. my father is a silent figure in my family, he did as mother commanded and never talked to his children once. physically present but emotionally absent.

when i graduated high school(force passed through) i went straight into the military to escape my toxic parents. i actually failed the asvab test and go by with a waiver because the military needed bullet sponges to fill its quotas. so a stupid fuck like me got into the infantry. i was the only one in my platoon that failed the written portion of the rifle range course and my entire platoon made fun of me for it. then when the time came for action i scored the highest marks in my platoon in accuracy. over two decades later i still remember the day my drill sergeant walked into the squad bay mind blown and astonished, telling everyone how an idiot like me cant even manage to pass the written portion of the rifle range but shoot better than the guys who passed with top marks on the written exam, everyone in the platoon cheered and clapped for me; they couldnt believe it. was it dumb luck? possibly. but it was the boost of confidence i had never felt before, it brought life back into my rotten soul. 

years later down the line i find myself in afghanistan, on combat patrol. long story short, my platoon sergeant and officers forgets to write up a radio watch list for radio checks. if you know anything about the military, radio checks are paramount, no radio check on the hour or designated time means you've been killed or something bad has happened. so the universe decides ive won the court martial lottery because i happen to be the first night watch on duty that night and didnt do a radio check, which i had no idea i was even supposed to be doing as no radio check duty list was put up. so typically the leadership throws me under the bus, a low ranking corporal literally 4 months away from an honorable discharge from the military. this is standard sop for the military, just like in the guantanamo bay controversy. throw the lowest ranking grunts under the bus and protect the leadership. so i knew what was coming next, a dishonorable discharge just 4 months shy of serving 4 years and getting out clean with my gi bill that would have saved my life to jump start my career in a trade school. a dishornable discharge or anything other than honorable means you dont get a gi bill, its bye bye. 

so i was despressed and suicidal in the middle of afghnistan, so far from home, which was depressing enough as it was, while lying in the bunk one night i loaded my m-16 put it to my head and cried for help. i threatened to shoot myself, but my bunkmate next to me yanked the muzzle away and everyone swarmed me. i was no longer safe to be around, they chained me up and flew me by helo to the nearest base with a combat psycologist. she assumed i was crazy, and authorized my shipment back to the us. i was crazy, crazy angry that my unit, the men i would have thrown my life down for in an instant in battle would betray me and throw me to the wolves. i was going to stand for it, so i wanted to show them but failed utterly. 3 months shy of finishing my 4 year contract with the military i was thrown out with nothing but a duffle bag, bank account nearly empty as a part of the punishment the military garnished thousands of dolllars as punishment. not like an infantryman is rich anyways, most of us spend all our time and money getting drunk and chasing women(not me, incel). most of the men in my platoon didnt have a penny to their name, and always came to me begging for a loan as everyone knew i was the guy that saved up.

21 years old, depressed, suicidal, almost 4 years of a career down the drain. actually thought i could have made the military my lifelong career. i found myself standing outside of the base with nothing, called a taxi to the nearest airport and went back the the place i tried to escape. went back to living in my parents house like a fool, a desperate fool because i was too afraid to beg any else for a handout or sleep on the streets, didnt even have enough money for a car. went to work in a factory for a few years, felt like hell, it was a souless, dead, and robotic job. turns out your experience in the military particularly infantry has zero civilian workforce translation. only thing i qualified for was flipping burgers, manual labor, and the jobs my infantry background did quality for(cop/security) was shot because the military had me on phiciatric record as having a 'personality disorder', whatever that means. even more depressed and suicidal, struggling to find a job and parents hounding me to help with the bills. id find a job but couldnt hold it down because of my depression. i often found myself wanting to sleep for upwards of 20 hours a day until it hurt so bad i had to get up. i just didnt want to get up, wanted to sleep until i died, but was too cowardly to kill myself. 

then came my mid to late 20s, still depressed and suicidal. still a virgin, never meet a woman and yurned for one. i was an incel, i had an inability to form intimacy because of my abused past. feared that everyone would betray me, because of my betrayal in the miltary i become even more reclusive. never trusted anyone as a friend again, still dont. jumping around from one souless and robotic manual labor job to the next because thats all i could get or hold down. desperately looking for a way out of it, but nothing in sight because of my adhd, tried going to community college to increase my value but just could not concentrate and was still suicidally depressed. 

then my parents offered me an out, so i thought. they never changed, still as closed minded, cold, ignorant, and toxic as ever, but now my parents started a farm and wanted to sign me on unofficially as a buisiness partner. said id get a quarter of it when it was sold off, like a guillible fool and desperate i said yes. we took on a 600k debt on the farm from the bank. i sacrificed 15+ years of my life working 50+ hours a week, 7 days a week non stop year round, zero vacation days, zero benefits(health, dental, vacation days), trying to pay off the debt to the farm. many of the beggining years the farm was in so much debt that i was taking 100 dollars a month in net pay. a few years later 300 a month, a decade later finally seeing a 1000 a month. i was so depressed living below the poverty line and those years were even worse for my suicidal thoughts. then i got into philosophy, the occult, mystery schools, manly p hall, etc. ive learned and matured alot in those years learning how to live with what i got and not lust after what i dont have. i learned how to live off the land and be happy with it. and now finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel, a farm of my own or a huge chunk of cash to finally but my own place and/or start my own buisiness, my parents want to remove me, kick me off the farm.

i had a terrible fight with them the other night just recently. i punched holes in the walls and came inches from hitting them. ive never laid a finger on my parents in my entire life, but i wanted to hurt them all of my life. they're trying to take away 15+ years of my hard earn work, my life. ive been kicked out of the house now, possibly for good this time, a house i was paying rent for, for 10 years. a house my siblings was living in with me without contributing anything at all, never washed the dishes, took out the trash, or helped pay the bills. i feel like im cinderalla without the happy ending, i do all the work and get zero thanks. 

&amp;#x200b;

i feel so low now, almost at my end now. about to lose 15 years of my work just like 4 years wasted in the military. almost 20 years down the drain. with nowhere to go i begged my father to be reasonable and at least let me park a shed at the edge of the property. spent 7k buying a little barebones shed, nothing in it. no electricity, no water, no insulation, and im living in it in at the start of winter. ive always wanted to live in a tiny house, a minimalistic life, but not like this, broke, and struggling. i feel like im going backwards in life, as in negative, minus degrees. 

&amp;#x200b;

something keeps driving my onwards and i want it all to end here and now. i feel like im just waiting for death, but im afraid whats on the other side of it. i welcome death, but am unwilling to do the deed myself. i feel like i could hurt my family and take the easy way out of this life. ride out the rest of it in the comfort of a cell with all my shelter, food, and health covered for instead of worry about where it'll come from tommorow. probably beg for mercy with a death penalty, but with my luck ill suffer with what id done for another 40 some years. at this point im almost 40 and halfway through my life. i dont suspect ill live past 80, and i hope not either. 

i know many of you will try to get me in trouble, anytime in the past ive tried to 'cry for help' nobody helped me, but only reported me to the authorities, which only lead to more trouble for me...

i guess i cry for help in the most absurd ways. unreasonable ways, i really must be a narssistic asshole...it may be that my narsissism does not allow me to take resonsibility for my life. ive tried but keep failing, like a drug addict that keeps relapsing. 

these are critical words i understand, and in order to protect myself i must say that this essay is a **work of fiction**. god forbid my situation get any worse than it already is, and if it is to get worse i want it to end on my terms. i understand how selfish it seems, im fucked, my life is a train wreck. my emotions are leeking out and i cant control it.

"group chat problem so i have this discord chat for people that go to my school and there's this one dude (for reference he is trans. is female, identifies as a dude). anyway, he has this kind of twisted sense of justice or something, allow me to explain. so let's talk about blm and police brutality. we all know that it's bad but said person thinks that it is ok to make jokes about white people and that people can't be racist to white people because apparently ""white people are causing all this so it's ok to do"". keep in mind, they aren't white.

exhibition 2- i don't exactly know what the joke was but they made a joke about cis people being bad. so the guy and two other (cis) people were talking and somehow they ended up talking about cis vs trans. the two (cis) people didn't know what it was so we explained it to them and they started to think that it was bad somehow because of the joke that the guy made. i and some others assured them that being cis was not bad and the guy who made the joke thought that everyone was offended and told us to calm down and that ""it was just a joke"". i told them that making jokes that target people isn't ok and that they shouldn't do it and they defended themselves by saying ""yeah, well in places trans people get hunted and killed just for being themselves and the murderers get no justice."". i don't know if i'm interpreting this wrong but he just said that because trans people are getting hunted in other places, that makes it ok to joke that being cis is bad to 2 cis people wh didn't even understand what it meant.

one thing i noticed is that they are not the ones that they are targeting. their targeting white people yet their not white, their targeting cis people yet their trans. when i tried a couple of times to flip what he's saying to show him what it's like to be the target of his ""jokes"" he gets mad and thinks that it's wrong even though it's ok when he does it or just says that the two are totally irrelevant

"does the universe want me dead?i keep looking back on my life, and i can't help but feel like the universe is trying to kill me.

literally from the moment i was born, i had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with. less than a year later, i got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized. a few years ago, i slipped on something (still no idea what the fuck it was), hit my head, and could've bled out if the doctor hadn't hurried the fuck up.

i'm also being driven to suicide by bullshit that's not my fault. i'm bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic. i've been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes. at one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though i was a well behaved student. it also doesn't help that i'm autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough.

on the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, i've just lost all interest in talking to him. i like him and he's really nice, i just lost interest for no reason. then that makes me feel lonely, and i feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide.

there are only two things that have stopped me from suicide. one is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me. the other is just a lack of planning. i don't know how i would even do it.

if the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? i want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up. that would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me. if i died tonight, my one friend and my cat would be upset. everyone else would get over it within 2 weeks i feel like.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"today i imagined how i will commit a suicide on new year nightmy life may look perfect to you. i'm 30 years old, working in tech industry in top tier company with good salary, recently was promoted. i know that i can find new better job in a day if i want to. recently i bought an expensive condo in downtown and have enough savings to solve not-anticipated financial problems.

i am living in foreign country, all my relatives are thousands miles away. i have only one friend and never had a girlfriend. the loneliness destroyed me mentally from inside over last year.

i'm suffering from a deep depression and derealization, receiving treatment for last 4 months. was working with 2 different psychiatrists, tried bunch of different medications without any signs of improvement.

i had suicidal thoughts for a while but they seemed to be manageable and did not bother me a lot. it was rather a curiosity.

couple of weeks ago i told my friend as a joke that if nothing changes in 2 months (by new year), i’ll have to figure out something, meaning maybe moving to other country (but internally i also thought about suicide).

tonight i was feeling significantly worse than ever and i figured that i won’t get better by the ny, and thought about how i will end it. in my imagination i went upstairs to the rooftop, stepped over the rail, thought about what i’m doing, spread hands like a bird, closed my eyes and stepped forward… i imagined that a few seconds i’ll be falling down and then everything will end. i reviewed this situation ever and ever again, thought about when i should do it so nobody can see me, what happens if someone will try to stop me….

it felt so real and scary. i got tachycardia, feeling of lump in my throat, had trouble breathing. i never was so scared in my life and not even because of this experience but because ny is getting closer and closer and i don’t anticipate any solution to my problem. i don't want to end it like this but i don’t want it to keep going.

"im done, i can't go on.god im so done with all this.

everyone in the uk is out here saying ""oh hell no, we've just gone into lockdown"" but only now do i realise just how sad my 17 years of existence has been.

there's been virtually no change to my life since the lockdown other than not going to school, and everyone else has social lives that they're desperately trying to salvage, and so's that they're trying to talk to all the time... i've got neither of them.

okay, i do have a friend group, i'll concede that. but all of them live at least 20 miles away. i don't get along with anyone i know in my city other than a few select people, and even then i don't talk to them often since they're younger people who i teach.

my school's been telling me to make sure my mental health is kept up. jokes on you, i've never had good mental health since year 9.

and the worst part is that i'm still as lonely as ever when it comes to romance... every other person that i know in my friendship group has found someone that they can share their life with, while also being able to confide their deepest, darkest problems in that person, and i'm still lonely as ever.

even my crush has said that i can't be with her, because she's got someone else on her mind... invalidating everything that makes me ""special"", even though she says that i'm a great human being. 

it's pretty simple... i'm not. 

i'm not worth it. i have no reasons to love myself, at all. i'm not good looking, i have huge self-esteem issues that won't go away no matter how hard i try, i'm the most irrelevant person in my city, i hate everyone in this city and i'm a musician.

musicians are fucking weirdos, and we own that. not in a good way though. the worst part is that i'm a singer. fml.

everyone keeps telling me that i need to love myself before i can love others, including the one that just broke my heart. 

but how do i do that if i don't have a reason to do so?

i really, really, really want to die. i don't want to be on this world anymore. i never asked to be here. and yet, all of that involves actually dying, which i really don't want to do for a multitude of reasons.

now would be the worst time to do that, with the global health crisis and all, but if i'm gonna kill myself, i'm probably gonna do it like kurt cobain: learn guitar, start a band, become famous, tour the world and then realise that no one cares about you, but they care about what you do. they only care about your legacy... then start a strong hatred for humanity and realize that you don't want others following your footsteps.

"help meone day i can be so positive and the next i feel suicidal... my moods are so all over the place ever since cps took my son for selling drugs. i am not getting him back my sister has him and he is starting to become more attached to her than me, sometimes i just want to end it. i have been child sex trafficked, domestically abused and lost my mother to cancer at 16 after my father left her because she was sick when i was 12.... life keeps throwing me stones and i just don't know how much more i can take. my heart is so big i am so empathetic and compassionate towards human beings but my ptsd and anxiety have made me isolate myself because it seems like i always get the same results from people. hurt and pain. i was an alcoholic for some of my teenage years i stopped that and now all i do is fret and worry unless i smoke marijuana which obviously just masks the underlying issue which is i am extremely depressed. i have never been very suicidal but thinking of how many times i thought about killing myself since my son was taken away makes me think i should maybe be concerned it has gotten to be multiple times per week now... the marijuana seems like it is actually my saving grace. i'm too much of a coward to go through with suicide because unless i get to go somewhere better which i can't be sure of i guess deep down i crave life. just a better one than i've had. the only good memories i have are before my mom was sick, early childhood. i'm damaged i know i am a good person but i feel so out of place and hurt. i just try not to cry. even now i feel like i shouldn't be complaining because some people have it worse but it is my reality. i'm fishing for kind words or advice.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"not sure what to do about this yesterday in a zoom meeting we had broke out into pairs and i was paired with a girl. normally this situation would make me panic since a) i don't like partner work,  and b) i'm bad at talking to girls. anyways, i kind of panicked a little at first but when she started talking to me it eased up a decent bit. we pretty much only talked about the schoolwork but a couple of times went off topic, but overall it just felt a lot more relaxed instead of being tense which was nice. and luckily for me i don't think i did anything to make her feel awkward and i'm kind of proud of myself for handling it the way i did (i have pretty bad social anxiety in general and girls are harder for me to to).


now while i'm not gonna be falling for her because of one instance, i am gonna be thinking about this for a while because i don't really get to meet and talk to girls very much, and considering that it actually went alright i kind of want to talk to her more, just as a friend really. problem is that since we're on zoom we don't meet in real life, and also when we go into groups it's random so it's very unlikely we'll get grouped or paired again. 

i guess there's really not anything i can really do but how should i cope with this feeling? i'm not having a crush on her but i did kinda want to talk to her some more since i enjoyed working with her",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"everyone i know hates me and i don't know how to handle it.	everyone i know hates me, for 3 years i guess i was on an alcoholic rampage, i dropped out of school in the ninth grade (due to bullying) and tried a homeschooling program that i pretty much ignored, there was never support on my mother’s end on any encouragement to help myself.  i went to the local community college at 16 to try and salvage some type of education. during this time i was dealing with severe mental health issues, mostly anxiety and never finished; so i decided to become a recluse and purely stay in the house only to come out and get cigarettes and using a cab service to go to counseling …. it wasn’t until 24 that i was convinced to make a effort to actually live and it was first of many horrible choices that i made in my life.


	i would generally meet men online have sexual relationships but generally avoid any type of emotional contact with them, there was a period that i dated a guy who was very accepting on my hermit lifestyle, i planned on just existing until i couldn’t do so any longer.  at 24 i met a guy who was much older and very kind, we planned to meet and many days i would have a new excuse not to meet him and at one point he made it clear he wouldn’t stop coming until i agreed to come outside and try to live and better my life.

	having been diagnosed with a long list of mental health conditions,  just going to the store was truly a terrible experience.  this man i met had a life where alcohol was almost central to it.  he was married to a woman and the relationship was complicated, but it was understood for a long time that he is a gay man so i was accepted as a person who could come by and hang out with them and it wasn’t an issue.  my social skills were almost an absolute zero.  i would sit at this table with my head looking down and just uncomfortably reply to any conversation that was directly pointed to me, and i would do it with as few words as possible. soon i started to realize after some drinking that it was a “great way” to rid myself of my social anxiety and become at least a bit talkative.

 	anyway this person would go out to the bars almost daily and insist i come along, there was never a point that i felt comfortable about just drink, he had two friends who would openly state that they felt they were looked at as “lesser” for hanging out with me, i started getting black out drunk almost nightly and i don’t know when or where my horrible comments started to appear, but i would constantly beg to know what happened, it was the greatest fear of my anxiety losing control.

	 i stopped going out for about a year and a half.  over that time my terrible behavior has been brewing in the minds of those i have upset and have been bothered with my behavior.  even on a few occasions in public
i’ve been called a pervert or a asshole.  i even had times where i’ve been home for months and someone would bring up something that absolutely didn’t happen, but i have lost so much credibility it wouldn’t even matter to try to challenge it.  i’ve had an issue where i almost started a fight with a person, and that is where all my problems started.  i deleted all social media because of constant death threats, and a few drunken arguments of my doing. i tried to just avoid the situation and disappear.  i ended up on what i thought to be a obscure dating app, and i received a bashing where a few things of my behaviors finally came out, including harassing and talking to women in a absolutely horrible way, claiming to not be gay and just enjoying the head; strange and ignorant comments about college not being a right and something about the second amendment--things that in my sober mind i never think of or even care about. sexually, i never thought of a time where i would even think of a woman in a sexual way like ever.  i have an affinity to them in the sense that i would generally find a woman as a doctor, counselor because i felt a bit more comfortable sharing my life with someone who could understand me without sexual overtones.  my main preference for that kind of support was generally gay men.  i  had all kinds of vague minor harassment then to the point when i would mention it to my psychiatrist i came off as crazy; my current psychiatrist even at one point asked if i was hallucinating.  finally, last night it all came out that it was a game of group harassment; many of the people who were harassing me i don’t even know, and for the first time i was faced with some of the things i  absolutely had no clue about.

	i thought finally accepting responsibility and explaining where i was coming from:  my childhood, my self esteem issues, even giving the information for them to find court records about my father to help collaborate the life story i tried to tell--it got no where, and i just received even more abuse.  i tried to explain i was truly sorry for my behavior and even tried to make sense of it myself, but it became obvious that their intent was purely to try to tear me down ever further. the gay community wont even acknowledge me, though they never really did before but now many feel totally justified in throwing as much abuse as possible at me.  i offer to go down to the police station and take responsibility for anything that was said i did. i ask what could i do in anyway to try to show that i genuinely didn’t mean the problems i caused?  i even still plan from now on to just stay to myself, but the abuse just wont stop. i don’t know what to do, all i feel is an amazing level of regret for ever getting in a situation where i did leave the house. i just wish that when i was getting out of control that someone would have actually just told me but that never happened.

	i know this post is too long.  i just need to say something and my mind is truly a wreck.  i just don’t know what to do anymore, i am more than willing to go into more detail, but i’m just so worn down… the worse part is none of these people are even willing to explain what is/was going on, so for many things i just don't know.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"life is so...crap!! i have had such a hard time recently! in september 2015 my nanna passed away which was extremely difficult to deal with. i do class myself as someone who can handle a lot and this wasn't the first time i've had to deal with someone close to me passing away... however within a few days of my nanna passing we find out that my mum has got cancer, and again i think i've handled it well and even though she has become much better with the treatment of radio and chemotherapy things are still continuing and she hasn't been able to eat since october last year however things are looking up which is good. 
so with all of that, i also had an extremely high maintance job which i worked for 10+ hours a day and had been there for 5 years working shift work and had finally had enough. i decided to leave my job and have a lovely christmas time off as i haven't had christmas off at all within the last 5 years and then start looking for a new job in the new year. i eventually found a job which was office work and completely different to my last job which i thought was what i wanted but even though the hours were better the job was 100 times worse! so i jacked it in! i've never been this person just to give up cause i don't like the disappointing others and i do care what people think however i couldn't stand it. so now i find myself jobless (however i do have an interview lined up shortly but i'm counting on getting it), without my nanna, my mum who is getting better but is still a long road ahead, and even though i do have an amazing partner by my side i feel like i've messed things up and on a destruction path (i hardly drink and don't do drugs) and i don't know what i'm doing at all, i want to cry but i can't, i feel like i need to be strong for everyone around me.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

we're all getting our performance reviews right now. turns out, the rest of the management team are getting the same grade as me and the personnel manager is getting the best grade possible. 

don't get me wrong; i'm not jealous. i just don't understand. some of the people i work with are completely useless, i (and others) have to spend our time fixing their varied and many mistakes. it's ridiculous. and senior management are well aware of the issues. so why the fuck have i given up so much, tried so hard, only to be told i'm only as good as the fucking idiots who literally do nothing? 

the personnel manager's grade is utterly laughable - the woman is awful at her job, we work in retail, yet she never leaves her office, does not talk to the store colleagues and actively gets off on gossiping about people. she's an abomination. 

i don't claim to be the best, never will. i just feel like this is such an injustice. why should i bother? i've been shit on constantly and i take it and come back for more.

my predictions for the ratings, based on the general consensus on the internet as well as my personal experiences, were that seasons 1-3 would be near perfect, with seasons 4 starting a low drop until season 8 hits rock bottom. then the show would slowly start to crawl back up. so here are my ratings for each season:

season 1: 95

season 2: 98

season 3: 97

season 4: 81

season 5: 77

season 6: 74

season 7: 68

season 8: 75

season 9: 90

season 10: 95

season 11: 87

season 12: 84

now here’s some fun facts i though were interesting (i should not the number that will be in parenthesis after the name of the episode represents the season it is in)

•my favorite episodes of the series were a five way tie for 100 being the episodes pizza delivery (1), band geeks (2), i’m your biggest fanatic (2), the camping episode (3) and it’s a spongebob christmas (8)

•my least favorite episode of the series was a pal for gary (7) with 22 points 

•the first three seasons were, as expected, the best in the series, with only 2 episodes getting lower than an 80, being as seen on tv (3) with 49 points and spongebob’s house party (3) with 67 points. spongebob’s house party would probably be the worst, but the patchy segments save it.

•speaking of patchy, the episodes involving him were very mixed, with most of them being good spongebob episodes with bad patchy segments, or visa versa. 

that’s it for things i found particularly interesting. here’s my favorite and least favorite of each seasons:

the best of each season:

season 1: pizza delivery (100 points)

season 2: band geeks (100 points)

season 3: the camping episode (100 points)

season 4: new leaf (97 points)

season 5: friend of foe (98 points)

season 6: no hat for pat (97 points)

season 7: krusty dogs (93 points)

season 8: it’s a spongebob christmas (100 points)

season 9: bulletin board (98 points)

season 10: mermaid pants (99 points)

season 11: squid noir (96 points)

season 12: spongebob’s big birthday blowout (97 points)

the worst episodes of each season (except 1-3):

season 4: squid wood (38 points)

season 5: spongehenge (34 points)

season 6: the splinter (26 points)

season 7: a pal for gary (22 points)

season 8: bubble buddy returns (41 points)

season 9: spongebob longpants (37 points)

season 10: plankton retires (32 points)

season 11: squirrel jelly (25 points)

season 12: the nitwitting (28 points)",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0
"i can't do this anymorei wake up and feel nothing. somehow it feels like everyday is the same day (since the outbreak i've completly lost my touch with reality and time) it feels fucking weird man. all i can think about is if i get to drink some alcohol in the evening (since i live with my parents) and numb my mind.

drugs became a huge value in my life, they show me different emotions such as love, confidence,carelessness and happiness.

and it fucking sucks. i can't get to experience this without drugs...

so this is hopefully my last fucking post.

"abandoned at every turn. loneliness is getting the better of me.when i was born i was left for adoption by my parents. my adoptive family however left me for foster care after a few years. growing up in foster care wasn't all that nice. i was given to various homes and at time there were abuse and at times things were nice but nobody ever took any interest in me.

after 18 i found my adoptive family who told me that the reason they left me was that they changed their minds about being parents. well. they're still parents as they have their own kid so i smelled bs but it is what it is. they gave me details of my birth family and i found that they have two other kids who they raised. one older and one younger than me. so they never wanted a second kid and i came by accident, so they left me for adoption. a third kid came by accident and they raised her. ain't i the luckiest kid on the block.

so at 18 i was lost and confused and got hooked up with some bad company and an older guy who played on my issues and got me into his gang of young boys. he got us moving drugs around the city. well i was busted and i didn't rat him out and i even confessed to something he did so i did 8 years. nobody came to visit me not my family not that guy. the horrors that happened to me on the inside is another subject altogether. i got out and i was basically on my own. couldn't find a job anywhere until i left the city did some hitchhiking and ended up at a small village where i got a job on a farm. it was nice. good people who never asked about my history. i stayed there for two years until i made the mistake of telling someone about my past and he told everyone and they wanted me to go.

i was moved and moved until found a place to stay with a very old couple in the middle of nowhere and i've been there ever since. it's not bad but i mean it's super lonely and no future so i don't know.

i have no reason to keep going. i've been thinking about ending it more and more and while i'm not feeling at my lowest right now i think it's just a matter of time for me. i always dream of dying in peace in a place where nobody would even care. it makes me feel peaceful.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"it really wasn't supposed to be like this...it's weird. i catch myself being afraid of myself when i realize i have plenty of moments that i'm not afraid to die. that i get calm and relaxed with the idea i'll die soon - when suicide swirls in my head. it's like i tell myself soon, i can put the shield down and just... stop fighting. i'm exhausted, every day. i cry. i want to shout. i wish someone in my family would hold me and just tell me it's ok - it'll be alright. but i dont think at this point, i'd believe them? i dont know.

&amp;#x200b;

i had an account prior. i tend to do this dumb thing where i delete it in a fit of self defeating mindset. maybe this is one of those moments. maybe i'm just broken like that. i'm told by my psych i have bpd. i suppose, a lot of it makes sense. i've lost so much over just this last year, that the idea of another year like it? i'm crying at the thought. i get headaches at the thought. the worst part is - i have memories where i felt ok. like things were going to work out... like normalcy was beginning to happen.

&amp;#x200b;

i dont subscribe to any religions. i don't believe in an afterlife. i'm mostly afraid only of a cyclic universe in that i, as a person with consciousness, exist only in this exact way. doing the exact same things, making the exact same mistakes, losing the exact same people. it goes against chaos theory, i suppose, and the cyclic universe model isn't very well seated amongst theorists, but like. what if. i don't know. on the flip side, it's also like what if shit were to get worse anyway? track record says it's going to.. if i end it here - and i happen this way again - then i'd be saving myself future grief? but it also implies determinism in that i'm not choosing to relieve myself of anything. it eliminates freedom. i guess i dont know.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm trying hard to articulate my thoughts, because i deep down don't want to die. but i don't want to live, if it means more of the same pain and heart ache and insomnia and stress, anxiety, financial issues, relationship issues. i want to stop earlier me from being such an ass to my ex wife. she stresses me out, for sure. she has faults for sure. but i acknowledge, i did not communicate with her in a healthy way. i'd shut in, until i snapped. i'd ignore her, mostly, towards the end.

&amp;#x200b;

if there's justice, at this point, i feel it serves for me to die, to see it's made. for the most part, i cut myself. on the wounds i already cut myself on. the tears it causes helps, but last time... no tears came. just emptiness.

"i feel weird posting on here when i’m so private about my feelingshere goes... for about 10 years i’ve had mild anxiety, mostly when doing something or going somewhere unfamiliar. however for the last few months it’s been getting worse and worse, i never want to go anywhere, i’ve started getting anxious when being at work when i’ve been there for almost 5 years and never had a problem before.

i keep feeling like i want to just die, i don’t think i would actually commit suicide because i feel awful doing that to my family, but i don’t see what i have to live for. 

i’m now a 32yo female living at home with my parents and sister and the only thing in my life i enjoy is shutting myself away in my room and playing a game or watching tv. 
i had a partner of 9 years who i just didn’t want to be with and so i ended the relationship last year and i’ve come to realise that i don’t want the ‘normal’ things in life. i don’t want a partner, i don’t want children, i don’t want to have to go into work everyday, i don’t want to go out drinking and dancing and all that crap, i used to be working towards saving towards getting a place of my own but i don’t even want that anymore. 

i can’t not work for the rest of my life but it’s getting harder to go in everyday and if i keep not going then i will lose my job which terrifies me, but i loathe having to be there against my wishes everyday feeling sick and anxious and on edge.

like i said the only thing i enjoy in my life is being on my own playing a game or watching something, but everyone tells me that’s not living or it’s no way to live, well why not when it’s the only time i feel content. i guess i’m starting to think that they’re right and i’m just wasting my life but the alternative is a life i don’t want. i feel like i’m just existing - not living, and it’s a struggle to keep going, i can’t see what i want for the future or possibly imagine what it will look like.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"i'm close to my breaking pointhey, i'm a 21yo, bi, and gender questioning. my last relationship ended ubruptly with my partner kicking me out to live with my mother who herself kicked me out when i was 15.

today i was beaten with a guitar by my 12 year old sister who snuck up behind me because she has massive temper tantrums when she doesn't get her way. my brother told me i am useless and that i only get used until someone better can be found to replace me (something which i believe and i had told him i feel).

"not dying as fast as expected.i've mentioned it here before, but i have a suicide plan in place. well thought out and with the absolute minimum impact on anyone, including strangers. just a disappearance. because i hate the idea of people having to deal with the aftermath of selfish suicides.

i am ill and slowly dying anyways, so the plan is to just watch my progress and take the trip when i see the turn in the road where i will no longer be able to take care of myself.

it was comforting. to know there was an end in sight. but it's not really moving now. i seem to be stuck in a stagnant state of excruciating physical and emotional pain. not enough to get any assistance, or to end my own suffering, but enough to make every day feel like hell. it's stripped away the little bit of respite i had left, the only thing i had to look forward to. 

it's been really aggravating my depression, as well as depleting resources to the point that i'm afraid i may not even be in a position to execute the plan when the time comes. maybe that's what ""not being able to care for myself"" looks like. maybe it is time and i just can't see it that way. i don't have time or energy to do anything with my life, and working as much as i possibly can only earns me just enough money to slowly slip into extreme poverty as i fall further and further behind on bills.

i didn't have anyone anyways. and even when i did no one really cared. but the state of the world now makes it pointless to even try to reach out as all the people who couldn't relate before are now in a panicked mindset that their life is unliveable. 

i really hate it. 

i'm putting no effort into hanging on and yet my body seems to have decided that we should survive, in this horrendous state, with nothing to live for. just lying in my bed staring at a pistol i can't use out of respect for others, but no way out.

just venting i guess. tl;dr: i was supposed to be dying soon but it doesn't seem to be happening as quickly as expected, and that has made me very sad.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i'm here partially because of suicide but also because i may hurt others and others may hurt themselves if i do what's right.honestly, the last year of my life has been a living hell but it's also been very eye-opening. about a year ago, i suddenly began to develop seemingly arbitrary anxiety attacks. nothing traumatic happened, nothing major changed in my life - my heart rate just randomly started spiking up to 140-150 bpm when i'm doing things like sitting or watching videos. after suffering with these anxiety attacks about 2-4 times a week, i reached my breaking point and i was literally ready to kill myself and take others with me. during my period of suffering i met a girl who at first seemed like the ideal girl for me but things quickly went south when her bpd started getting in the way. her insecurities are just something i couldn't deal with. overtime, i went from being depressed and feeling hopeless about the entire situation to angry. i didn't understand why any of this was happening to me. i was an otherwise normal guy in my mid-20's when this disease just began manifesting itself for no apparent reason. i was finished, done for, i wanted to kill myself and go out with a bang. i wanted to take others with me. i dialed the suicide helpline and i spoke to somebody for an hour straight. at the end of the call, an anxiety attack manifested itself and i called 9-11 for what seems to be the millionth time. i just couldn't take it anymore. my mind was racing. my heart was pumping faster than it ever has. i was feeling weak, dizzy. they took tests, they gave me medicine, they did everything they could and i think i've been to the er more than anybody active in this subreddit combined. 

""it's just anxiety, you'll get it over it.""

""here's some xanax and some ssri's, take them and you'll get better""

""you need to see a psychologist""


and so i did. i didn't get better. i had planned my suicide down to the very smallest of details, and nobody knew. not even her. then, i had a day of clarity. my anxiety dissipated. i felt ok for one day. wonderful. great. sleep. wake up. i feel better. i take a shower. i eat. normally it's triggered by now. everything is fine. another day. no anxiety. i continued to live. day. by. day. i delayed suicide just one more day. then, just one more day. then, just one more day. two weeks passed of blissful normalcy. then, i started hallucinating. i started to hear voices and only for just one day. i started to see lights, i started to see shadows surrounding me. everything got darker. i nearly passed out on the street. i called the ambulance. checked by er. nothing is wrong. it's just anxiety. 

**it's just anxiety**

but no, it isn't. it can't be. something must be wrong. the voices, the hallucinations, the colors, the darkness. i'm schizophrenic, but i couldn't be. i told myself i needed to fight this disease because i'm too good for it. i can't have schizophrenia. i just can't. i filtered the voices in my head out and i used everything in my will-power to bring myself to normalcy one more time. just as fast as the voices and hallucinations came, they left. it's been months since.

you may reading this and thinking i'm crazy. crazy is a broad term to me. i don't feel like you either be crazy or not. i think it's a spectrum. some people are more crazy than others, but they may not be labelled as crazy. did i think i was crazy? do i think that i'm crazy now? no. but this anxiety sure is driving me crazy!

so more months passed, and my girlfriend's bpd seemingly started to get worse. and i seemingly got better. i used all the money i worked for to do a downpayment on a nice car and i've been living my life the way i've wanted to. i don't listen to others, i do whatever the fuck i want. do i want to drive out to that sushi restaurant and order too much food and take it all to go? you bet your ass i do. do i want to speed in residential streets and narrowly avoid the cops? sure i fucking do. i'm in control of my life. i've always been in control of my life, it's just that my control slipped for last couple of months and when it did, i almost did the most terrible things know to man. i'd appear on news stations, guaranteed. but i was better now. i'm normal again. i started taking road trips with my girlfriend and my friends and we have had an absolute blast. i have loved every single minute of it. 

then, my girlfriend did a shit-test on me. she asked me if i watch porn. i said yes. ever since then, her insecurity has grown massively and she even **attempted suicide** because i wasn't willing to compromise with her. she wanted me to straight up stop watching porn. i wouldn't. 

i was initially going to talk about how all of this has fueled my anger and it has made me into a vile human being that's been wanting to selfishly kill but i decided to just stop. i texted my girlfriend right now and i broke up with her in the most terrible way possible. i'm emotionally hurting so much right now. i didn't want to do it because she might kill herself but i can't fucking handle it anymore. 

we had such a great time.

i've been depressed/anxious/mentally ill for ten years now. i have a chronic pain condition which exacerbates the depression and the depression exacerbates the chronic pain. my dad is abusive and getting worse, he's starting to act out physically slightly, and i'm terrified me/my mom/etc are next. he's a narcissist who wouldn't even apologize for stealing my prescription meds, amongst other things he's done. he'll do favors or ""nice"" things and hold them over your head. i can't leave because i have no money and my mom can't leave because she's dependent on his health insurance for her heart disease &amp; copd. i can't afford therapy.  


i have no friends because i ghosted all of them. yes, every single one, and i have no idea why. it just felt like it was too hard to keep talking to them and try to be a good friend. i don't leave the house because i have nothing to do, and it's not like you can really socialize right now due to the pandemic. i'm trying to get a job but it's going nowhere, and honestly i kinda don't give a fuck because i'm so depressed. i don't enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. i'll play a game for ten minutes and quit because it feels pointless. when i try to make friends online it's so fucking hard because it feels insanely difficult to try and be interesting and fun when i'm so depressed.   


i don't know what to do. i feel like nothing is ever going to get better and i'll be alone forever. even if that isn't true, i can't handle the depression right now, and the fear of living with my ever-increasingly abusive father, and just the general toxicity of the house because of it. everything feels like a sprint and my ankles are broken. i just want the fuck out.",suicide,suicide,1.0
"what used to scare you in your childhood, and what scared you in the last 1-5 years as teenagers? i remember when i was 6 years old (i think?), i used to be scared so easily from the old lotto ads from my country, they had those small weird creatures with numbers on them, and they were scarying the shit out of me, using their stupid scream, that at the time, it was like a huge jumpscare for me.
and those ads were even played in the radio! so imagine how many times i had to suffer this stupid scream, over and over and over, not to mention it took me like 4-5 years just to get used to it.
well, those ads still exist nowadays, but so far they stopped with the scream, so i will forgive them just for that.

so anyways, about 2-3 years ago (i think?) from today, i was listening to some pegboard nerds songs, when suddenly i came across their collab with an artist named ""snails"", entitled ""deep in the night"", the artwork was pretty scary, but not too much scary tbh, but it was only the beginning, so after listening to the song, i went to snails' soundcloud page to see if i am interested in more of his songs, and i had absolutely no fucking clue that i would enter one the scariest place of edm that i currently know whatsoever, so anyways after scrolling down a bit, i came across his collab with a twin named ""botnek"", entitled ""waffle house"", and it's artwork, has quickly became no other than my 2nd worst nightmare, still to this day, and that nightmare literally gave me a huge trauma for like two weeks.
i don't even want to say what was in the artwork, if you are curious af, just search the song on youtube, but don't say i didn't warned you.
so anyways, the trauma faded from my brain, but i am still afraid if i will ever see this artwork ever again, because i know that if this will happen, the trauma will most likely be back to me.

so these are the two traumas that i remember most from both my childhood and my teenagerhood, but i am curious, what were yours? i would like yo know. :)",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

"i've been doing ""controlled"" hanging for a few months nowwhen i was 16 i promised myself i would hang myself on my 20th if nothing gets better. i turned 17 yesterday. although i won't kill myself right now, i've been practicing hanging i guess you could say. when everyone's out of the house i'll tie myself up to the staircase railing and see how far i can go. the first time i did it i was just gagging before i stopped. the second time i did it i was coughing gagging and gasping for breath rapidly. the 3rd time which was just now, my vision got blurry, all my rapid breathing became raspy, my stomache was hurting, i had a weird sound in my ears where i couldn't hear much else through it, and i could hear my heartbeat really loudly. when you do it for real is it worse than this? or is this the extent of what it feels like? after experiencing an overdose, hanging myself only is a slight discomfort and panic compared to the agony if an overdose.",suicide,suicide,1.0

even my friends don’t want to spend time with me. they barely talk to me and generally ignore me. the one friend i thought i would have forever is mad at me for trying to drink my pain away and not being honest with her. i wish i wasn’t such a failure that i could tell her that i love her. i wish she wouldn’t be disgusted with me when i said it. 
i wish i could just kill myself. i never asked to be born and no matter how much i pray for death it never comes. i’ve spent more time praying that i never awake than i wish i did. i wish i was a stillborn or just wasn’t even conceived. life isn’t full of joys. every second is pain. every hour feels like a thousands years and yet a single second at once.

"i don't know even know why i'm still here. love and hateit all started in january last year. i met this american girl online through mutual online friends on ps4. things went fast and we became more than freinds. stuff happened sexually within the first week and carried on for about 4 weeks (i always had suspicion she was lying about her age but i was always reassured by freinds and other people she knew) i'm 21 but then i found out she was 13 (birth was 16 november 2002) there was an argument but after a few days of talking we decided that we could be freinds as we both were helping each other through things (she suffered from depression, anxiety and bipolar which made it sort of understandable as to why she lied about her age to everyone, even to her freinds which she had known for a few years) we kept what we had did silent but a few people knew. unfortunately these people decided to tell people. we had arguments a then somehow more sexual contact had happened and i don't know how or why even though we both knew our ages this happened a couple times. but then another argument and she threatened to get the police on me and called me a paedophile so i sort of panicked and released screenshots of convos (sexting etc which i know is illegal) but i released them cos i was angry and scared and to prove that she was the original instigator in our sexual contact. but it only gotten worse from that. she started receiving death threats and i told her to go to the police but she wouldn't. then i started to receive death threats (i still do to this day) then the worst happened. people from her school found out and started to bully her to the point that she got really deep into depression and so did i. i eventually couldn't take much more and took some tablets but it wasn't enough. i was bed ridden for 3 days, but then she found out and thought that i was maybe dead and she got scared and it got to the point where i think she actually did it cos no one heard from her after that.

i want to go to the police but they already got involved and won't help, i've even got in contact with the police over there in usa (manassas city) but they don't care or don't believe me

fast forward a few months and i got really bad, it was always on my mind and i always was ready to do it, plans and everything. but i tried to talk to my close freinds. people i had known for 7 or 8 years and i told them the full story when we were at the pub. but then a few days later i got a message from one or them saying the other 2 are going to betray me and get the police on me for doing things with a 13 year old 

i panicked but somehow i was already ready to do it so i did again. 32 tablets, paracetamol, and full bottle of jaeger. i was in hospital, police interview but i lied a bit to the police cos i was frightened and still am.

i go everyday waking up just thinking about it and her and it's the last thought on my head. sometimes i feel like just walking into the police station, or just jumping into front of a tram. one day it could go either way and i'm scared",suicide,suicide,1.0

"today is the closest i've been to suicide.i've dealt with depression for a very long time and an eating disorder for a time shorter than that.  i fucked up big time with the girlfriend yesterday and since then have been spiraling.  today we talked on the phone for over an hour and it sounds like we may be able to negotiate a relationship that works for both of us, but it sounds like a lot of work.

i guess my biggest concern is that we both made lists of what we need out of the relationship, and in her top 5 was great sex (like we used to have).  i relapsed into the disordered eating rather suddenly and haven't really wanted sex or to be naked since then.  i know it has been really hard for her and i *do* love her a lot, but right now it seems like something impossible to give her.

i've also fallen back in to self-injury (which i hadn't done since 2006).  the locations have become more visible and a bigger pain to hide.  i just want to close myself off from everyone and sleep for a while.  suicide just seems like such a comfortable solution right now.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"35 may as well be 80i wasted my teenage years and first years of my 20's recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome, having my dad die and then taking care of my mother 24/7 after six months after my dad died. i wasted my twenties by trying to work out what the fuck i had to do. my dad was 63 when i was born and retired by the time i was in school. he had lost his hearing in world war two. my mum was in her late 30's. when i was in grade 4 or 5 she had a massive mental breakdown (manic depression) and had to retire from being a 30+ year school teacher. she never worked again. as a child/teen i associated hard work with mental illness and personal tragedy because that's what i knew.  when i first started to be really good at something i got glandular fever which was later diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome. just as i recovered from that dad died suddenly. six months later i took care of my mother 24/7. she died a week before my 22nd birthday. by that point i had no education - couldn't go to school when i was caring for her (was before i knew about distance ed.) - the next couple of years were trying to sort my life out. i got my vce. someone from my past took pity on me and got me a job in the usa. 

i fucked that up. i had a stroke and lost my shit. got involved with the wrong people - who took me in when i got out of hospital from my stroke (which cost me my job because i couldn't stay out on the road working it). i stayed in america rather than admitting defeat and going home back here to australia. i ultimately went to jail for crimes they committed. because i couldn't prove that i was innocent didn't think i had a chance so i pleaded guilty before it even went to court. i did my time and got out. i wanted to redeem myself but of course that's easier said than done. i went back to school and got two university degrees - degrees in internet communications and professional writing and editing - great lot of good they'll do. arts degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on. i'm halfway through a marketing degree (all started since i got out of prison).

i'm meant to be moving to brisbane next week with my partner of 4 years. the second they do a background check on me they'll find what happened to me overseas. well that's great - it means that we'll be trying to move states with her already having taken the position to improve her health and be homeless because nobodies going to rent out to a criminal. 

i cant get a real job so i do my best writing articles for websites. some freelance writer i am. 

i have cancer and the likelihood of recovery from that is low. i think i'm better off dead before it kills me slowly and i put my partner and family through even more grief.

im 23 i like think that im slim fit. 
basic work out everyday, i like to fix things that are broken say it maybe a broken electric fan ill have myself electrocuted if i need to just to fix that thing or cut my fingers reparing a broken vase. 
my latest project was a laptop that my cousin bought for around 100k pesos (ph ) took me three days the power wasnt circulating properly and not turning the damned thing on. 
after a few frustrating days of sitting fown and experimenting i finally got the thing back alive. 
it felt like i just revived a person with my hands.
 it felt good. 
i dont sleep very often. 
having an hour of nap or two maybe 3 would be grand for me. 
most of the time im just on my social feeds just staring at animal photos. 
that cheers me up always. 
i always have these "" thoughts "" 
say a girl says i look handsome its always followed by a voice saying she probably needs something from me or maybe someone gives me something as a gift automatically think that now i owe him .
trust? 
its not in my dictionary. 
these past months just pushed that word away from me farther. 
i had a girlfriend that promised me that shed never let go. 
you know what happened. 
i had a bestfriend of 15 years
yeah we had up and downs. 
before then i thought those downs were already settled. 
during the last weeks of my relationship my bestfriend told my girlfriend that he loves her. 
that basically came to me as a fucking tsunami againdt a small fishing boat. 
it all came crashing down after.
she broke up with me claiming that im in the way of her studies. 
even tho im always been supportive in all possible ways when shes stressed about anything study related. 
i make sure im always there when shit goes down. 
and i know i did a good job. 
i am not a happy person. 
i have these momentary mental breakdowns 
like waves of negative thoughrs pulsates through the layers of my mind. 
i have no way of dealing with it except just being quiet and let it pass through like rain to a sunny day.
or a mist to a mountain. 
one night we three, me my gf and my bestfriend were hanging on the rooftop of my gf's condo just chilling yalking about stuff. 
and i had a fucking meltdown. 
i didnt realize its been 2 hours and ive just been staring at a fucking plant. 
then when i woke up i just wanted to cry. 
i was crying on the inside. 
but on the outside i just smiled and excused myself saying i felt sick and wanted to go home. 
my bestfriend responds with alright i gotta go too. 
so yeah expecting them to head their own ways. 
i went home too with proper goodbyes and apologies. 
i spent another 3 hours staring at the ceiling of my room. 
after crying myself to sleep. 
3 am. 
i went out to look for food. theres this 24/7 place near a bus top that night commuters take. 
and there i saw the two. 
seemed like gf was walking my bestfriend to the bus stop. 
they seemed very surprised to see me. 
i didnt even speak. 
i just walked past them and kept to myself. 
my mind was all over the place. 
i knew what was going on but i was hoping i was wrong. 
my gf kept calling me. 
asking whats wrong and saying how rude of me to ignore them like that.
i just made up an excuse that she easily accepted then things were as if nothing happened. 
bf started talking to gf about my "" issues "" 
at this point i just tell myself just let it fix itself. 
and me being hopefull and wishing things would be different i let go of what happened. 
but i always get reminded with the fact that they talk more often than i do with my gf. 
my bf excessively gives more gifts to my gf. 
and seems to appreciate him more often that she does to me. the thoughts they pile up. 
but always, i always find the strength to push them away after all. 
they're only ""thoughts "" or "" intrusive thoughts as my gf calls it. "" 

after work i head to a net cafe to steam off. 
i receive a text that me and my gf needs to talk. 
then i broke down. 
the person thats been slowly building me up and the foundation of my progress is about to let me go. 
so i asked are you gonna break up with me? 
"" im sorrry. "" 
i wouldnt take it anymore. 
i lost it. i went home got a kitchen knife 
laid on my bed i lay on my stomach elevating my chest off the bed just so the knife ( handle to the bed the blade to my chest ) fits for 2 hours i was on a death plank. 
quiet. 
no crying. 
just blankly staring back into my pillows while my elbows supported my weight. 
after that. 
i just found myself drink 3 sleeping pills. 
the next day i didnt get off my bed. 
i couldnt eat or drink anything. 
i had no energy. 
my throat was dry. 
my stomach was grumbling. 
this went on for a full week. 
then i started to cut my wrists again. 
something ive stopped doing.
the last scar i had was from 2009. 
this was when my parents were throwing ceramic plates at each other like they were trying to make them fly like ufos. 


my cousins sends me a message "" yo i need help with my thesis "" 
i felt like i have a purpose again. 
so i gave everything i had into the new project. 
i was temporarily happy. 
i forgot about the small cut on my chest. 
which have just recently stopped bleeding. 
and the cuts on my wrist started to dry up. 
just perfectly covered by my watch. 
i can still feel the sting of when my sweat touches the wounds. 

ive convinced myself not to care about what happened anymore..

thanks my cousin says for sure anytime i reply. 
after that hes graduated from college
 congrats
we start to hang out more often. 
but no i dont feel that i have a new friend. 
im just that guy they call if they have no choice.

they live in a nice quiet village
 
i took a long ass walk at 1 am 
i realized i can try harder to be better. 
a second chance. 
i opened myself up to new people
i met this korean dude named alaycia 
and noji. 
the other is recklessly childish and the other is slyly gay aleays hinting sexual stuff towards me. but theyre cool nonetheless.
this gal ive been following on one of my social medias.
i saw her promoting a desktop tower. 
her smile stuck with me. 
ever since i saw it ive always brought it with me then. 
i happen to come across a familair face on fb.

"the only person who was ever kind to me, is me.it wasn't always that way. i had a huge problem with self loathing for a looooong time, up until about 3 or 4 years ago. as is typical with people suffering suicidal ideation.

 in the past 3 or 4 years however i've grown to really like myself, i became very involved in politics and found my footing on the compass.

 i found solidarity with the oppressed all around the world and cherished it. it even gave me a lot of hope for a brighter future.

however, with each passing day on this shit hole planet, my skin peels. i fucking hate everyone around me. all they do is make noise and fucking hurt me. 

the kindness i've shown myself in the past few years is simply leagues better than the way i'm treated by others. i just want to be alone with myself for the rest of eternity in the ground somewhere.

i want everyone else to fuck off forever, just leave me fucking be. i like myself and i'm the only person i want in my life. 

the thought that everything could be over as soon as i will it to be so is so fucking attractive. the idea that all of existence as it is perceived by myself can me upended in one motion from my ring finger.

its intoxicating, i could have everything i want out of existence. to rest alone for all eternity with the one being who ever dared see me as human, myself.

but for once in my life i want to be selfish. i hate myself,  i have always hated myself, my dearest wish was to have died before i could have been hurt. 
hopefully we will meet in the afterlife wherever and whenever that will be, i hope i have the courage to take the leap and i don't back out like i have before.

"i want to die but i don't want to kill myself at the same timehi,

i read a few posts on here so i went ahead and created an account.

i have horrible panic attacks to the point where i can't breathe, i had one in early hours of today and today morning. i am stressed and anxious and depressed all at the same time.

i feel numb and exhausted both mentally and physically. i don't take care of myself, i cannot even make myself shower most days nor brush my hair. i am in education and working at the same time. i have dreams. dreams i don't want to give up. when i want to give up, theres this small percent that tells me i should get through it.

i am so physically and mentally exhausted and tired its unreal. i barely have any energy for anything.

i want to die but i don't want to give grief to my mum who has suffered herself all her life and given me the most amount of love and care to me that she could ever give. i am also scared that if i died, this would make her life miserable and there would be no-one to look after her like i will and do.

i need help. i need a routine. i need something. i have lost interests in everything i found interesting - i loved photography, loved poetry. i do not do any self care. don't exercise. don't drive. 

i want someone to plan my life and schedule out so i can just follow it. i know this sounds stupid but i just want anything to help me to manage and sort my life. is it normal to be this mentally and physically exhausted and wake up out of breath frequently.

i am 24, i have completed my 3 year degree for law. i am currently on route to becoming a solicitor. most times i want to throw it all away.

"sharing. problems.i have a lot of problems and i'm pretty sure i have mild mental illness.  i have never been diagnosed, but there are just some things you know.  there is a lot wrong with me, a large part of it is severe social anxiety.  when i talk to people, or need to be near people, i start sweating profusely.  i cannot make eye contact, if i do it's for a split second.  i'm very awkward.  i'm alone, and being alone for all my adult life, which i'm only in my early 20's, has been miserable.  i don't have friends.  i don't know how to make them.  i don't have a boyfriend because i don't know what guy would ever want me.  

i'm a computer science student.  most of my time goes towards programming.  unfortunately, i'm becoming so hopeless and my depression is deepening to the point where i can't even focus on my work anymore.  this area of study requires me to work non-stop all day, barely sleep, i barely eat.  i have no free time.  i love my field of study, however the depression is making it very hard to focus and stay motivated.  it's not what i'm doing that is upsetting.  it's how i'm living.

"nowhere left to turn.i’m 27 years old and live in the us. i’ve been with my so for 8 years this month, and apart from her i don’t really know if anything would have kept me alive this long. i dropped out of college when i was 20, after having to work long hours with two jobs and fighting a constant battle with anxiety and depression, thinking maybe i just needed a break from the stress, but after the past 7 years of working low wage jobs, living check to check and constantly under threat of being homeless, i realized in a dream last night that it probably was my only chance to do any better for myself.  i’ve made mistakes like anyone else, but have always been able to somehow recover to make more. things weren’t going so well financially before this pandemic, but we were making due. we both lost our jobs, and were living off the stimulus for the short while it lasted, and fell behind on many bills, the most important of which being a month and a half’s worth of rent, and a couple worth of electricity. luckily they passed a mandate not allowing eviction, which expires this month. when they prematurely opened everything back up, my so got a new job, but i’ve had no such luck and have been trying to use doordash to make ends meet, but as anyone who has worked a gig will tell you, it alone doesn’t suffice, and beyond that, our vehicle is 26 years old, and hardly wants to start anymore. i just dropped over $700 into keeping it running last month instead of catching up on those bills, so we could continue working. my electricity almost got cut last week, but i managed to find a payment plan to buy us another two weeks. then the eviction notices started coming. we live in a low end apartment, and i’m sure they’ve had this goal in mind for awhile now and are delighted at the green light to take everything left from us that we haven’t pawned...i’m only out a couple thousand, which may not seem like much to many of you, but it’s literally our entire lives hanging in the balance now. i don’t know what to do. i feel so weak, and like i’ve failed her even more than myself, and although she understands and is one of the most loving people i’ve ever met, i feel like i’m just dragging her down at this point. even if i were to get a good job today, it would be too late. i have no credit so loans aren’t even close to an option. at first i held out hope for a second stimulus, but anyone will tell you here that you can’t depend on the government for much of anything, let alone actually helping people when they need it. our elected officials would just call me weak or pathetic if they had the chance, as they like the denounce anyone unlucky enough to be poor. that i’m not working hard enough, or that i’m just a scumbag, a failure. it’s not worth letting that get to me, but this is easily the lowest point of my life. i don’t want to leave her all alone, but i think maybe if i was out of the picture, her family might at least take her in. mine is worthless, and couldn’t help even if they wanted to, but i don’t want to think about that right now. i’ve been crying in this parking lot all morning, hoping to make $5 or $7 here and there with dashing, while she’s working her ass off to impress her new job. i can’t take it anymore, i’ve got no one left to talk to, and am finally realizing that this time, there won’t be some miracle to save us, we’ve been lucky enough to make it this far. i don’t know how i’m going to do it, but i want to die in a way that i can just disappear, to cause the least amount of emotional pain possible to her. maybe i can convince her i’m a piece of shit so it won’t hurt as much. i don’t even have a gun anymore, pawned it a couple months ago, and have no idea where to even start. was hoping i would just get sick and die from lack of healthcare, but i guess working so hard has made me pretty hardy so that doesn’t seem like it’s coming. not even sure what the point of writing this is, and i know i’m not alone in this disparity, but i’m at the end of the line. i can’t keep composed when i hear her cry, i know there’s nothing i can do but listen. but this is it folks. i hope some of you make it past whatever brought you here, it’s not always fun, but keep fighting til the end. at least i can say i fucking tried...but i give up. i’m sorry.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"fairly scaredive thought about committing suicide for as long as i can remember. this is the worst it's been since i was in third grade. 

i hold onto hope for things to get better but the better i want is fictional, i've known for a while that what i want to happen is very very unlikely. i want to write stories and get a small fanbase or find love or find someone who'll show regular worry about me and be like ""oh i see you're not doing well, are you okay"" which is silly but i fantasize about people asking me if i'm alright a lot.

i usually just think about killing myself but every now and then i take it a little further and today i got really close to actually doing it which is scary honestly. i don't want to die but i also definitely can't live, this world was made for people but i don't feel like i was made like other people.

when people talk to me i struggle to hear them or come up with responses and i don't know where to look or what to do with my hands and sometimes i forget how to walk properly. i'm dumb as rocks and i work at the garden center at walmart and im awful at it, coworkers will ask me to do something and i rarely understand it.

im also really hard to look at, i have these super creepy eyes and my hair is crazy no matter what i do to it and i cant grow good facial hair and my body is shaped weird. i come off as really intimidating ans scary and this makes it so that no one wants to be near me but thne the people who do regret it when i struggle to tzlk.

im bad at academic things too.

im bad at writing and drawing or anything hobby-like. i feel that i have no skills whatsoever. 

im bad at everything i can think of honestly.

i'm very very fragile and small stressors are all i need to crumble, oh they've boosted my hours time to sob all alone. no one would want ot be near someone like that. i don't even look human in the mirror especially when i cry. i look humanadjactent, its like i can barely recognize my face as my own when i look at it.

today i was having it really bad, i was so tired and ive been working so hard and ive been trying my best to stay healthy and look nice and earn money and ive been trying my best to get better at things and ive just been trying my best but then i broke my tv and some stupid game ive been playing broke too and then i was checking my phone and it randomly died and it feels like someone was vert specifically telling me i couldnt be happy and i feel like everything is breaking again and im gonna stop having the energy to clean myself again. 

i really am trying my best i really want everyone to know that it was never much but the effort i give really was my all i just wanted to be better and happier.

today unlike the other bad days i wrote a note and even grabbed my pills, i was so close to doing it but i thought against it and now im here begging for attention on the internet.

i know it may sound stupid but i really really want a hug, if anyone no matter who they were just held me or told me that they truly wanted me to be better then id be so happy but no one is like that in real life. sure on the internet its a little diffrent but in ral life i dont thinkg anyonke is going to be there for somene like me

"some thoughts about boredom well, to start this, i'm gonna ask you a question: when was the last time you were bored? and by 'bored' i mean not just a casual boredom like when you're in a class you actually don't care about. do you remember being bored as a six or seven yo child, when you were literally just sitting around and thinking 'what should i do now?'? because that's exactly that kind of boredom i'm talking about.  

if you are like me and most of my friends, you either can't really remember, or it's been quiet a long time, or if it wasn't that long ago, that doesn't happen that often any more. well, that's a good thing, that means we've always got something meaningful to do, right?

wrong.

for most people nowadays, the force of habit grabs you, so that you'll grab your phone and start scrolling on instagram, reddit, twitter, whatever. would you consider that activity as important, productive, or all in all a positive thing? i'll leave that up to you.  

now, let's change the topic for a second. i'm just assuming that i'm kinda average, so i'll guess that you often find yourself saying 'oh gosh, i'm so uncreative' too. but why? why so? thinking back, i was pretty creative as a child, and i would draw quiet a lot, imagine my own games, play outside with friends and always thinking of new stuff to try. so, what has changed? obviously we aren't children any more (or at least like to think that…). what else has changed?  

i'd point my finger towards something that's nowadays pretty much omnipresent: the internet. we are not bored any more because we instinctively go on the internet to check what's new, which wasn't possible when we were still those six or seven yo kids. i'd actually even be brave enough to use the word 'addiction' here. many people, especially younger people, like us, are addicted to the internet without realizing it. please do me a favour and quickly check on your instagram and youtube how much time you've spend there on average per day in the past week. (you can to that somewhere in the settings; sadly i haven't found that on reddit…)  

okay, done? no? it doesn't matter. the numbers are just for a personal connection to this topic, and you can just keep on thinking with me by questioning yourself: does it make sense how i spend this time? of my 24 hours per day? just for fun: take your daily average and multiply it by 365. that's the time you'd spend on social media per year.  

now imagine what else you could achieve in this time. learn a new language? well, it can surely achieve you basic knowledge. do sports? definitely great, and maybe you can even learn a handstand in that time? drawing? awesome! the next vincent van gogh will rise! (but please keep your ears, the world sounds better with them).

i want you to think about your future. eventually, you'll be old, and eventually you'll be as old as your grandparents. maybe you'll have grandchildren! and let's be honest, it is waaaay cooler to be that grandpa who can cook really well, or maybe can draw really awesome, or is still able to do a handstand with 70, instead of being that old dude who just sits around all day and waits for the sun to set, so he can go to sleep again. but how can you reach that? let me tell you one thing: not by staring at your phone all day.

at this point i could go more into detail about addictions etc, but i'll leave the research to you. don't just believe some 'facts' a random guy on the internet tells you. but let me tell you this: the world is so much more than just the internet. be brave enough to be bored and just think for a while. literally do \*nothing\*. put everything aside and just let your thoughts go wild. your brain is amazing, but you need to leave room for it to breath. stop giving it input every second you have, and just let it do some work and create something. even if it's 'just' thoughts.  

do you think people of the past, like leonardo da vinci, albert einstein, ludwig van beethoven, you name it, would've been able to do the things they did if they had just stared at their phone all day long? certainly not.  

some brief informations about me: i'm 19 yo and i'm studying physics at uni in my second semester now. this week i've got 3 exams. while preparing for them, the phrase 'where the fuck did my time go again?' did not just appear more often because i miscalculated while studying the theory of special relativity, but also because i'm procrastinating. a lot. and instead if using my free time to do creative stuff, i waste it by watching stupid videos on youtube, that i actually couldn't care less about. as a result, when i should study i can't concentrate, because my brain is constantly looking for something to distract itself with something more 'fun' (what really is a bummer, because maths and physics are awesome and just beautiful). (actually its looking for something to get dopamine quicker than by actually studying, but again, do research on your own about addiction and that stuff).  

so, what's my plan? for me, i want to 'reset my brain' and stay off the internet for a week after my exams are done, and bring it back more conscious and constantly asking: do i really need this? or could i do something better with my time?

and what should you do now, after reading this?  

i don't care. you can put your phone down and just think about what i just told you. or you can get active and immediately start doing something you always wanted to get started on, but never felt motivated enough to really do it.

or you can just go back to your feed and let this post be one of many others, and probably won't be able to remember reading this in a few hours. you don't have to agree with me, it's fine.  

the decision is yours.  

some final words: i'm not a great writer or anything (so, sorry for any writing or spelling mistakes), but just wanted to get rid of some thoughts. even if only one of the few people who read this takes a brief moment to think about all of this (and hopefully beyond; i could just keep writing, but at some point i eventually need to stop), it was completely worth writing this and sharing it. 

my dudes and dudettes, you are still young. you are the future. so please be aware of what you consume and what you're doing with your time. your teen years are so powerful when it comes to development and setting a foundation for your life, so please use them wisely.

thanks for your attention and take breaks.

"at the end of the ropei was living in brazil for the past few years with my now ex-wife. she cheated on me so i called my dad and asked if he could help me out til i can get back on my feet.

my dad lives at my grandma's so that's where i ended up. my little sister and her disgusting weirdo husband live there too.

one night he got wasted and started accusing me of stealing shit and all kinds of crazy person shit. he then attacked me and when i locked myself in a room he broke the lock and attacked me further.

i was then somehow blamed for all of this and have now been essentially couch surfing with nowhere stable to go.

i was supposed to be getting help with a car but that seems to be falling through as a result.

i should've known better than to trust my family, sad to say but true.

i want nothing more than to work and provide for myself but with no car and no stable home, little clothing, no way to shave or afford a haircut, i feel absolutely screwed.

i've asked all my friends and family other than my dad's side and they either don't get the dire nature of the situation or just don't care.

i'm not asking for a free ride and don't want to mooch or anything.

i've looked around a bit for help from the government but that seems to be in short supply.

suicidal ideation has been crossing my mind with more and more frequency. if i end up sleeping outside then i'm just going to end it.

"i need immediate help.i'm a 19 year old boy, and have been heavily depressed and suicidal since i was 12, when i for the first time, tried hanging myself. 

i've been seeking help since age 14, but with no great succes.
for the last years i've failed different educations, because of my mental condition which is slowly tearing me apart. 

i am constantly imagining guns to my head, ropes around my neck, the ground smashing my body, etc. and it haunts me, even when i'm in a somewhat good mood. 

about a year ago when i help finally came, i was by mistake diagnosed as a schizophrenic. i had to walk around with this dagnosis hanging over my head, and swallow anti-psychotics that would eventually make me fall asleep in the middle of every morning classes. after a half year, i demanded a new diagnosis because i've never been psychotic.
after a single conversation with a leading doctor, i was diagnosed with dystymia and heavy depressions.

i was prescribed prozac, and when i started on 30mg things suddenly became joyful. i was open-hearted, i was happy and i had confidence. while everything suddenly was going well, i decided to drop acid with some friends (all of us with an already daily usage of cannabis) it was wonderful and for the next 2 weeks i was happy. i dumped by girlfriend through 2 years at the time. i was certain that i would start from scratch. all of a sudden girls were attracted to me. i had no problems getting laid, and my friends' jealousy, was a sign to me that i was on the right track. i was sure that the days of my suffering had end, and i could finally be happy.
for some reason one weekend could destroy all those thoughts. i've had the best days of school ever. as another weekend approached everything went great. but after the weekend, i was back in school and no one seemed as happy as me. suddenly depression hit me. i was lonely again. yeah i was happy, but no one around me were. ever since then i've been extremely depressed. i'm losing friends and i'm losing my grip. it seems to all start over again. for the last month i've tried suicide 5 times. last time yesterday. my only will is to die in peace. i am a lonely soul.",suicide,suicide,1.0

[here's our conversation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/15ziie/i_want_to_die_now/c7ra65i) i think i clarified my point in my last few posts, especially [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/15ziie/i_want_to_die_now/c8cvlbw) because my colleague stopped responding (either that, or he gave up on me! :p).

here's a relevant thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/dtyiy/to_all_the_well_intentioned_yet_ill_informed/ my opinion rests with the top comment in that thread (the poster is deleted). i think that in extreme / emergency cases (i.e. people about to kill themselves - appropriate in this subreddit), it's ok to use slightly 'stronger' methods than would be used when talking to a depressed person who is ok with life. i believe that our jobs here are to bring people away from the edge of suicide - to give them inspiration - nothing more. the rest of their lives are up to them.

so i'd like to see what you guys think. which side do you agree with more? [i think both sides have valid points]

a majority opinion would be rather useful here, so we could establish some 'ground rules.'

i trust you guys to make the right decision. i'll try my best to follow along with the decision in the future.

"stop bullying bullies suck we all hate them. they think ""oh i'm just kind of rude i couldn't be emotionally scarring anybody"" wrong. first, stop glorifying bullying. kids are like ""oh well i can be kind of rude but it's not that big a deal"" wrong. don't try to get on a bully's good side so they think you're cool and befriend you. you are just telling them that what they're doing is okay. second don't normalize bullying. as much as i hate it when people play the victim, if you are the victim of bullying you can play the victim. if they call you a coward for this just ignore them. why should you care what a bully thinks?? but never let a bully think bullying you is normal and never ignore as much as insulting. just tell them to shut up. third make certain places where bullies know they're not welcome. i plan to make an art club and if any bullies try to join i won't let them. if you have a club or a friend group let everybody know this is a bully free zone. if your friends won't kick out a bully and you've tried everything they might be bullies. people who glorify and normalize bullying are normally bullies themselves. thank you for reading.",non-suicide,non-suicide,0.0

don't get me started on the animal cruelty. fair enough that the disgusting human race has to kill them for meat, but jesus fuck, do it painlessly. i'm sick of it. this is what triggered my hatred for this world. i seriously would love to see a bunch of useless humans be locked up in cages for their skin, for breeding and for food, and then slaughtered. it would be fun.

the other part of the problem is that it always fell akward for me to engage conversation with someone else so i grew up as a loner. i'm scared because i fear i will not be able to get to know people. what worked for me, in the past was to volunteer for a suicide hotline, it helped build confidence but i don't know if i'll be able to continue to do this while studying at the same time. especially knowing that i will be far from the place i always lived in the past.",non-suicide,suicide,0.0

thank you everyone for the advice. i am extremely appreciative.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"frick corona i just broke up with my girlfriend because she lives in another country and i can’t visit her because of corona. last time i saw her was in december. i just lost interest in her. well she is perfect, beautiful and an absolutely wonderful person but after a while it just felt unreal. it is almost impossible to have a long distance relationship without it crashing. 
i broke up with her in a good way but it still made her really sad (understandable) and i feel like shit. 

i really hope we can talk to each other in the future. i’m so so sorry.

"7 or 8 daysin 7 or 8 days i'll have been single for a year. feb 2nds the date. just idk whether or not january has 30 or 31 days. my life turned to shit feb 2nd. 2 days before was the happiest day of my life. then i found out i was being cheated on. then i didn't get accepted to colleges. i got into a shitty job i hate. i developed many substance addictions. i lost friends as they moved on. i stopped being able to meet new people. i became a shell of what i once was. i'm not me anymore. 

in july i said if i was single for a year (feb 2nd) i'd end it. i guess it's crunch time now. only 7 or 8 days left. but i doubt anything will go right in that time. guess i'll drive really fast into a tree. my neon won't save me from shit. idk why i felt like posting. just wanted to vent. it was great while it lasted. to bad it won't be anymore. thanks y'all. reddit has been fun",suicide,suicide,1.0

"please help mei’m starting to unravel. at my job i hired someone that has more qualifications than me, i’m afraid they’re going to fire me and give him my job. he deserves it, because i’m so messed up and confused i’m doing a terrible job anyway. i know the people there hate me, but i need it because i have a lot of debt i need to pay off. i’m recently divorced and i left behind 3 beautiful cats that were like children to me. i miss them so much it physically hurts me. my parents loved my ex husband and were devastated that i left him. they are strong, conservative christians and are very judgmental. 

i started seeing this guy that i used to date in high school. my parents absolutely hate him. he’s more of a free thinker like me, has tattoos. he loved me for who i was and he was my best friend. i loved him so much. i have something wrong with me, i’m not sure. the therapist said it was major depression. i started pushing him away. i told him that i wanted to take a break to figure things out. i went cold, stopped talking to him. he threatened to tell my parents about our secret relationship to try to get me to talk to him. he showed up to the place my dads band was playing at and i freaked out. if they knew about our relationship they’d disown me, i’d never get to see them again or be the maid of honor at my sisters wedding. i told him i never wanted to see him again and he said he was going to tell everyone about our relationship.

i came clean to my parents, told them i had been seeing him behind their backs out of fear that he’d tell them first. they’re furious at me. my sister won’t speak to me. and my ex now has a new gf. i still love him and it hurts to know he could move on so quickly. everyone that i love is gone.

i’m all alone. my betta fish is dying. i can’t do a single thing right. please someone talk to me. i hate the silence. i’m so fucked up. it’s all my fault.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i hope you all find your happiness one dayi’m a 20 year old girl who, over the past year, has been silently coming onto this page every time i wanted to die. this is my first time posting. i moved back home from college after my freshman year. i’m supposed to be a junior, but i’ve only been able to do school part time from home so i’m behind on credits. i have a job that i like. i have a few close friends, but they all live hours away. i have a loving family.
mental illness destroys me every day. i was diagnosed with severe ocd at age 5. i’ve been depressed since i was 11. i have extreme anxiety and difficulty regulating my emotions which, combined with the obsessive nature of the ocd, results in obsessions with boys and relationships that usually end up collapsing. 
there really aren’t words to describe the complicated nature of my mental illness or the indescribable pain that it had caused me throughout my life. if you’re in this sub though, i’m sure you understand. 
i want to be in love more than anything in the world. a year ago i met a boy who i connected with like nobody else. he couldn’t be in a relationship with me, and when we broke it off i had to be hospitalized for a few months. i got out and found healing, but we reconnected and he broke it off again. that was in march. since then, i’ve had two different brief relationships, but those failed too. i kept coming back to him. i’ve never felt close to somebody like i did with him. a few months ago, he moved across the country. we kept checking up on each other every month. today i found out that he has a girlfriend. i lost it again and i guess i had just lost it one too times. his patience ran out. his empathy was gone. he told me he never wants to speak again, and that if i contact him again he will block me. his tone was angry and apathetic like i’ve never heard and i know that he means what he says.
i can’t fathom a possible life that i want to live. i don’t have the energy to pursue passions. im surviving, but every few weeks i have an episode that inhibits functioning for a couple days until i can pull myself together. i have no joy, no friends, no imaginable future. i’m miserable here but i’m terrified to change. my mind torments me, it never shuts off.
tonight, after my family goes to sleep, i want to slit my wrists in the bathtub. i know you have to hit the radial artery and i think i can do it, i’ve had to get stitches on my wrists before. 
i want it to end. i want this pain to go away. i have been hanging on for so long and i’m so exhausted. he kept me here. i have a message written out for him, nothing manipulative, just telling him thanks for everything and that i’m sorry. 
if you read all of this i appreciate that. i’ve read so many of your stories and they always make me cry. i hate that so much of us are in so much pain and i hope that we can find our happiness one day.",suicide,suicide,1.0

"i am suffering and i dont feel it will ever endi come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. i have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but i still feel like utter hell. i am pretty sure i have some kind of ptsd from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. i have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. i feel so alone and forgotten. i feel like i will never be loved that i am just a stain upon the world. i am crying as i write this because i just wish i wasnt alone in this world. i wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. even if i lost them i would be grateful that i could trust that i loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so i have to leave them. why am i so forsaken? i try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body.   


nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. i have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her i would be alone. she tells me to be present but when i am present i feel like i am at the bottom of a rotten pit. i have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and i fear i will always be an outcast. i wish i had love in my life, i wish i had people who would hug me or tell me i was lovable, who would tell me i wasnt stupid and i was going to be okay. i am hanging on by threads at this moment... trying to find things in the world to enjoy like i did when i was much younger. as soon as i started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if i were gone, i am already just a fading memory to everyone i have ever known. the reason i stay now is that i try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",suicide,suicide,1.0
